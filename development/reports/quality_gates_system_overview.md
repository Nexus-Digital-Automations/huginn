## Usage Examples

### Running Complete Assessment

```bash
# Run full pre-implementation assessment
bundle exec rake quality_gates:pre_implementation[new_webhook_agent,moderate]

# Run assessment with verbose output
VERBOSE=true bundle exec rake quality_gates:pre_implementation[api_integration,complex]
```

### Running Individual Phases

```bash
# Context assessment only
bundle exec rake quality_gates:context[feature_name]

# Security review only
bundle exec rake quality_gates:security[feature_name]

# Performance baseline only
bundle exec rake quality_gates:performance[feature_name]
```

### Huginn-Specific Tasks

```bash
# Pre-implementation check for new agent
bundle exec rake huginn:agent_check[email_notification_agent]

# Pre-implementation check for major refactoring
bundle exec rake huginn:refactor_check[agent_architecture_refactor]

# Quick security and performance check
bundle exec rake huginn:quick_check
```

### Report Management

```bash
# List all assessment reports
bundle exec rake quality_gates:list_reports

# View specific report
bundle exec rake quality_gates:report[/path/to/report.yml]

# Clean up old reports
bundle exec rake quality_gates:cleanup_reports[30]
```

## Configuration

### Quality Thresholds

The system uses configurable thresholds for each assessment phase:

```yaml
quality_thresholds:
  context_assessment: 70      # Minimum score for context analysis
  impact_analysis: 75         # Minimum score for impact assessment
  resource_planning: 70       # Minimum score for resource planning
  security_review: 85         # Minimum score for security validation
  performance_baseline: 70    # Minimum score for performance capture
  overall_minimum: 75         # Overall minimum score to proceed
```

### Huginn-Specific Configuration

The system includes specialized configuration for Huginn:

```yaml
huginn_integration:
  agent_analysis:
    min_agent_types: 10
    required_concerns:
      - 'LiquidInterpolatable'
      - 'WorkingHelpers'
      - 'DryRunnable'
  
  database_integration:
    required_tables:
      - 'agents'
      - 'events' 
      - 'users'
      - 'scenarios'
```

### Environment Overrides

Different environments have different requirements:

```yaml
development:
  quality_thresholds:
    overall_minimum: 65       # Lower threshold for development

production:
  quality_thresholds:
    security_review: 95       # Higher security requirements
    overall_minimum: 90       # Higher overall requirements
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Implementation Phase

1. **Feature Planning**: Use resource planner to estimate requirements
2. **Architecture Review**: Run context assessment to understand current state
3. **Risk Assessment**: Use impact analyzer to identify potential issues
4. **Security Planning**: Run security review to identify protection needs
5. **Performance Planning**: Capture baseline for comparison metrics

### During Implementation

- Monitor that implementation stays within planned resource boundaries
- Validate security measures are properly implemented
- Ensure performance doesn't degrade beyond acceptable thresholds

### Post-Implementation

- Compare final performance against captured baseline
- Validate security measures are working as intended
- Confirm resource usage matches planning estimates

## Reporting and Documentation

### Assessment Reports

Each assessment generates comprehensive reports in YAML format:

```yaml
assessment_summary:
  feature_name: "webhook_agent"
  implementation_type: "moderate"
  overall_score: 78
  status: "passed"

phase_results:
  context_assessment:
    score: 85
    details: { ... }
  security_review:
    score: 92
    details: { ... }

recommendations:
  - "Consider implementing rate limiting for webhook endpoints"
  - "Add comprehensive input validation for webhook payloads"
```

### Report Storage

Reports are automatically saved to `development/reports/` with timestamps:

```
development/reports/
├── pre_implementation_assessment_20241127_143022.yml
├── pre_implementation_assessment_20241127_151205.yml
└── quality_gates_system_overview.md
```

## Extension Points

### Custom Analyzers

The system is designed to support custom analyzers:

```ruby
class CustomAnalyzer
  def initialize(rails_root:, logger:, config:)
    # Initialize custom analyzer
  end
  
  def analyze(implementation_spec = {})
    # Implement custom analysis logic
    {
      timestamp: Time.now.iso8601,
      custom_metrics: { ... },
      score: calculate_score,
      recommendations: generate_recommendations
    }
  end
end
```

### Custom Configuration

Add custom configuration sections to `quality_gates.yml`:

```yaml
custom_analysis:
  specific_requirements:
    - requirement1
    - requirement2
  thresholds:
    custom_metric: 80
```

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

- Context assessment: ~2-5 seconds for typical Huginn installation
- Impact analysis: ~1-3 seconds depending on complexity
- Security review: ~3-7 seconds including vulnerability scanning
- Performance baseline: ~5-10 seconds including sample measurements
- Total assessment time: ~15-30 seconds for comprehensive analysis

### Scalability

- Designed to work with Huginn installations of any size
- Analyzer integration layer prevents resource conflicts
- Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms
- Efficient caching of repeated analysis operations

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance

1. **Update Advisory Databases**: Keep security vulnerability databases current
2. **Review Thresholds**: Adjust quality thresholds based on team capabilities
3. **Clean Reports**: Regularly clean old assessment reports
4. **Update Configurations**: Keep Huginn-specific configurations current

### Version Compatibility

- Compatible with Rails 7.0.1+
- Requires Ruby 3.2.4+
- Designed to work with current Huginn architecture patterns
- Extensible to support future Huginn enhancements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration Not Found**
   - Solution: Ensure `config/quality_gates.yml` exists
   - Fallback: System uses default configuration automatically

2. **Assessment Timeouts**
   - Solution: Increase timeout values in configuration
   - Check: System resource availability during assessment

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Solution: Ensure proper file system permissions for report directory
   - Check: Rails application has write access to `development/reports/`

4. **Analyzer Failures**
   - Solution: Check individual analyzer logs for specific errors
   - Fallback: System continues with remaining analyzers if one fails

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
VERBOSE=true bundle exec rake quality_gates:pre_implementation[feature_name]
```

### Configuration Validation

Validate configuration file:

```bash
bundle exec rake quality_gates:validate_config
```

## Conclusion

The automated pre-implementation checklist system provides comprehensive, production-ready tools for validating implementation readiness in Huginn. By automating the manual checklist process described in development mode documentation, it ensures consistent quality gates while reducing manual effort and improving reliability.

The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Huginn development workflows while providing the flexibility to adapt to specific project requirements through its comprehensive configuration and extension capabilities.
