They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Below them are instructions to get you started.\n\n![Example list of agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/your-agents.png)\n\n![Event flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/diagram.png)\n\n![Detecting peaks in Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/peaks.png)\n\n![Logging your location over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/my-locations.png)\n\n![Making a new agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Docker\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Below them are instructions to get you started.\n\n![Example list of agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/your-agents.png)\n\n![Event flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/diagram.png)\n\n![Detecting peaks in Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/peaks.png)\n\n![Logging your location over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/my-locations.png)\n\n![Making a new agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n📖 **For comprehensive documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**\n\n### Docker\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](docs/images/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

    "originalFile": "## Deploy to Heroku\n\nHuginn works very well on the cheapest Heroku paid plan. This is what we recommend if you want to use Huginn on Heroku.\n\nNotes for any Heroku plan:\n\n* The `setup_heroku` command points Heroku at a special Procfile (`deployment/heroku/Procfile.heroku`) that is designed to be run on only one Heroku web worker.  If you want to run multiple workers, change the Heroku config variable `PROCFILE_PATH` with `heroku config:set PROCFILE_PATH=./Procfile` and switch back to the standard Huginn Procfile configuration.\n\nIf you still wish to use the Heroku free plan (which won't work very well), please understand the following:\n\n* Heroku's [free plan](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) limits total runtime per day to 18 hours. This means that Huginn must sleep some of the time, and so recurring tasks will only run if their recurrence frequency fits within the free plan's awake time, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, we recommend that you only use the every 1 minute, every 2 minute, and every 5 minute Agent scheduling options.\n* If you're using the free plan, you need to signup for a free [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com) account and have it ping your Huginn URL on Heroku once every 70 minutes.  If you still receive warnings from Heroku, try a longer interval. \n* Another way if you're using the free plan, you can create a Http Status Agent on your Heroku Huginn instance itself and ping your own domain at huginn-example.herokuapp.com every 10 minutes.\n* Heroku's free Postgres plan limits the number of database rows that you can have to 10,000, so you should be sure to set a low event retention schedule for your agents and set `AGENT_LOG_LENGTH`, the number of log lines kept in the DB per Agent, to something small: `heroku config:set AGENT_LOG_LENGTH=20`.\n* 512MB of RAM may not be enough for Huginn and it may stop working as RAM usage increases over time.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and then run `heroku login`\n* Go into your huginn directory and run `cp .env.example .env && bundle`\n* Now, run the magic setup wizard: `bin/setup_heroku`\n* That's it!\n* If you make changes, you can re-run `bin/setup_heroku`, or just do `git push heroku master`.\n* Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/update.md) when you want to update your Huginn installation.\n\n### Using your own mail server\n\n```bash\n# Outgoing email settings.  To use Gmail or Google Apps, put your Google Apps domain or gmail.com\n# as the SMTP_DOMAIN and your Gmail username and password as the SMTP_USER_NAME and SMTP_PASSWORD.\nheroku config:set SMTP_DOMAIN=your-domain-here.com\nheroku config:set SMTP_USER_NAME=you@gmail.com\nheroku config:set SMTP_PASSWORD=somepassword\nheroku config:set SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com\n\n# The address from which system emails will appear to be sent.\nheroku config:set EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=you@gmail.com\n```\n\n### Backing up your data\n\nSee: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export\n\n### Example output from `bin/setup_heroku`\n\n```\n~/projects/oss/huginn (master)$ bin/setup_heroku \n\nWelcome andrew@example.com!

    "originalFile": "# Installation from source\n\n\n## Important Notes\n\nThis guide is long because it covers many cases and includes all commands you need.\n\nThis installation guide was created for and tested on **Debian/Ubuntu** operating systems. Please read [doc/install/requirements.md](./requirements.md) for hardware and operating system requirements.\n\nThis is the official installation guide to set up a production server. To set up a **development installation** or for many other installation options please see [the getting started section of the readme](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started).\n\nThe following steps have been known to work. Please **use caution when you deviate** from this guide. Make sure you don't violate any assumptions Huginn makes about its environment. For example many people run into permission problems because they change the location of directories or run services as the wrong user.\n\nIf you find a bug/error in this guide please **submit a pull request**.\n\nIf not stated otherwise all commands should be run as user with sudo permissions or as root.\n\nWhen having problems during the installation please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Huginn installation consists of setting up the following components:\n\n1. Packages / Dependencies\n1. Ruby\n1. System Users\n1. Database\n1. Huginn\n1. Nginx\n\n## 1. Packages / Dependencies\n\n`sudo` is not installed on Debian by default. Make sure your system is\nup-to-date and install it.\n\n    # run as root!\n    apt-get update -y\n    apt-get upgrade -y\n    apt-get install sudo -y\n\n**Note:** During this installation some files will need to be edited manually. If you are familiar with vim set it as default editor with the commands below. If you are not familiar with vim please skip this and keep using the default editor.\n\n    # Install vim and set as default editor\n    sudo apt-get install -y vim\n    sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\nInstall the required packages (needed to compile Ruby and native extensions to Ruby gems):\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit build-essential git zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server checkinstall libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev logrotate pkg-config cmake nodejs graphviz jq shared-mime-info\n\n\n### Debian Stretch\n\nSince Debian Stretch, `runit` isn't started anymore automatically, but this gets handled by the init system. Additionally, Ruby requires the OpenSSL 1.0 development packages instead of 1.1. For a default installation use these packages:\n\n     sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd libssl1.0-dev\n\n### Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic\n\nTo start `runit` automatically on Ubuntu Bionic, we need to install `runit-systemd`:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd\n\n## 2. Ruby\n\nThe use of Ruby version managers such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/), [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with Huginn in production frequently leads to hard-to-diagnose problems. Version managers are not supported and we strongly advise everyone to follow the instructions below to use a system Ruby.\n\nRemove the old Ruby versions if present:\n\n    sudo apt-get remove -y ruby1.8 ruby1.9\n\nDownload Ruby and compile it:\n\n    mkdir /tmp/ruby && cd /tmp/ruby\n    curl -L --progress-bar https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/3.2/ruby-3.2.6.tar.xz | tar xJ\n    cd ruby-3.2.6\n    ./configure --disable-install-rdoc\n    make -j`nproc`\n    sudo make install\n\nInstall foreman:\n\n    sudo gem install foreman --no-document\n\n## 3. System Users\n\nCreate a user for Huginn:\n\n    sudo adduser --disabled-login --gecos 'Huginn' huginn\n\n## 4. Database\n\n### MySQL / MariaDB\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\n\nFor Debian Stretch, replace `libmysqlclient-dev` with `default-libmysqlclient-dev`. See the [additional notes section](#additional-notes) for more information.\n\nFor Debian BullsEye:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev\n\nCheck the installed MySQL version (remember if its >= 5.5.3 for the `.env` configuration done later):\n\n    mysql --version\n\nSecure your installation. During this step, you will be prompted to pick a MySQL root password (can be anything)\n\n    sudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nThe `mysql_secure_installation` script does not apply the user-provided password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems. To apply a password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems, see the [additional notes section](#set-password-for-root-MySQL-user-on-Ubuntu) for more information before proceeding.\n\nLogin to MySQL using the root password you set in the previous steps\n\n    mysql -u root -p\n\n    # Type the MySQL root password\n\nCreate a user for Huginn do not type the `mysql>`, this is part of the prompt. Change `$password` in the command below to a real password you pick\n\n    mysql> CREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\n\nEnsure you can use the InnoDB engine which is necessary to support long indexes\n\n    mysql> SET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n    # If this fails, check your MySQL config files (e.g. `/etc/mysql/*.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/*`)\n    # for the setting \"innodb = off\"\n\nGrant the Huginn user necessary permissions on the database\n\n    mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\nUse the flush privileges command to save the new permissions\n\n    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nQuit the database session\n\n    mysql> \\q\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H mysql -u huginn -p -D huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you replaced $password with earlier\n\nYou should now see `ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'huginn_production'` which is fine because we will create the database later.\n\nYou are done installing the database and can go back to the rest of the installation.\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql libpq-dev\n\nCreate a user for Huginn and set its database connection password. If you want the user to be able to create the database, add `-d`\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createuser -P huginn\n\nCreate a database\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createdb -O huginn -T template0 huginn_production\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn psql -h localhost -W huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you set earlier\n\nYou should now be greeted by the `psql` interactive client and be connected to the `huginn_production` database. Quit the database session with `\\q` or `CTRL-D`\n\n## 5. Huginn\n\n### Clone the Source\n\n    # We'll install Huginn into the home directory of the user \"huginn\"\n    cd /home/huginn\n\n    # Clone Huginn repository\n    sudo -u huginn -H git clone https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git -b master huginn\n\n    # Go to Huginn installation folder\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n\n    # Copy the example Huginn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp .env.example .env\n\n    # Create the log/, tmp/pids/ and tmp/sockets/ directories\n    sudo -u huginn mkdir -p log tmp/pids tmp/sockets\n\n    # Make sure Huginn can write to the log/ and tmp/ directories\n    sudo chown -R huginn log/ tmp/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/ tmp/\n\n    # Make sure permissions are set correctly\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/\n    sudo -u huginn -H chmod o-rwx .env\n\n    # Copy the example Unicorn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp config/unicorn.rb.example config/unicorn.rb\n\n### Configure it\n\n    # Update Huginn config file and follow the instructions\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor .env\n\nIf you are using a local MySQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn MySQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    #DATABASE_HOST=your-domain-here.com\n    #DATABASE_PORT=3306\n    #DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n    # MySQL only: If you are running a MySQL server >=5.5.3, you should\n    # set DATABASE_ENCODING to utf8mb4 instead of utf8 so that the\n    # database can hold 4-byte UTF-8 characters like emoji.\n    #DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4\n\nIf you are using a local PostgreSQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn PostgreSQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    DATABASE_HOST=localhost\n    DATABASE_PORT=5432\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n\n**Important**: Uncomment the RAILS_ENV setting to run Huginn in the production rails environment\n\n    RAILS_ENV=production\n\nChange the Unicorn config if needed, the [requirements.md](./requirements.md#unicorn-workers) has a section explaining the suggested amount of unicorn workers:\n\n    # Increase the amount of workers if you expect to have a high load instance.\n    # 2 are enough for most use cases, if the server has less then 2GB of RAM\n    # decrease the worker amount to 1\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor config/unicorn.rb\n\n\n**Important Note:** Make sure to edit both `.env` and `unicorn.rb` to match your setup.\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\n**Note:** For configuration changes after finishing the initial installation you have to re-export (see [Install Init Script](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/installation.md#install-init-script)) the init script every time you change `.env`, `unicorn.rb` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Install Gems\n\n**Note:** As of bundler 1.5.2, you can invoke `bundle install -jN` (where `N` the number of your processor cores) and enjoy parallel gem installation with measurable difference in completion time (~60% faster). Check the number of your cores with `nproc`. For more information check this [post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler). First make sure you have bundler >= 1.5.2 (run `bundle -v`) as it addresses some [issues](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/411) that were [fixed](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/2817) in 1.5.2.\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle install --deployment --without development test\n\n### Initialize Database\n\n    # Create the database\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Migrate to the latest version\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Create admin user and example agents using the default admin/password login\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n\nWhen done you see `See the Huginn Wiki for more Agent examples!  https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki`\n\n**Note:** This will create an initial user, you can change the username and password by supplying it in environmental variables `SEED_USERNAME` and `SEED_PASSWORD` as seen above. If you don't change the password (and it is set to the default one) please wait with exposing Huginn to the public internet until the installation is done and you've logged into the server and changed your password.\n\n### Compile Assets\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production\n\n### Install Init Script\n\nHuginn uses [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to generate the init scripts based on a `Procfile`\n\nEdit the [`Procfile`](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile) and choose one of the suggested versions for production\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor Procfile\n\nComment out (disable) [these two lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L6-L7)\n\n    web: bundle exec rails server -p ${PORT-3000} -b ${IP-0.0.0.0}\n    jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\nEnable (remove the comment) [from these lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L24-L25) or [those](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L28-L31)\n\n    # web: bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb\n    # jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\n**Note:** Ensure you have no leading spaces before `web:` or `jobs:` in your `Procfile` file.\n\nIf you use a directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/` for the app, change the location of the `runit` logfile in `lib/tasks/production.rake`, for example:\n    run('foreman export runit -a huginn -l /opt/huginn/log /etc/service')\n\nExport the init scripts:\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:export\n\n**Note:** You have to re-export the init script every time you change the configuration in `.env` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Setup Logrotate\n\n    sudo cp deployment/logrotate/huginn /etc/logrotate.d/huginn\n\nChange the location of the log directory if you have chosen to log to a different directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/log/`\n\n### Ensure Your Huginn Instance Is Running\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:status\n\n## 6. Nginx\n\n**Note:** Nginx is the officially supported web server for Huginn. If you cannot or do not want to use Nginx as your web server, the wiki has a page on how to configure [apache](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Apache-Huginn-configuration).\n\n### Installation\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n### Site Configuration\n\nCopy the example site config:\n\n    sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/huginn\n\nMake sure to edit the config file to match your setup, if you are running multiple nginx sites remove the `default_server` argument from the `listen` directives:\n\n    # Change YOUR_SERVER_FQDN to the fully-qualified\n    # domain name of your host serving Huginn.\n    sudo editor /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n\nRemove the default nginx site, **if huginn is the only enabled nginx site**:\n\n    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, replace the `huginn` Nginx config with `huginn-ssl`. See [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for HTTPS configuration details.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nValidate your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file with the following command:\n\n    sudo nginx -t\n\nYou should receive `syntax is okay` and `test is successful` messages. If you receive errors check your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file for typos, etc. as indicated in the error message given.\n\n### Restart\n\n    sudo service nginx restart\n\n# Done!\n\n### Initial Login\n\nVisit YOUR_SERVER in your web browser for your first Huginn login. The setup has created a default admin account for you. You can use it to log in:\n\n    admin (or your SEED_USERNAME)\n    password (or your SEED_PASSWORD)\n\n\n**Enjoy!** :sparkles: :star: :fireworks:\n\nYou can use `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:start` and `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:stop` to start and stop Huginn.\n\nBe sure to read the section about how to [update](./update.md) your Huginn installation as well! You can also use [Capistrano](./capistrano.md) to keep your installation up to date.\n\n**Note:** We also recommend applying standard security practices to your server, including installing a firewall ([ufw](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) is good on Ubuntu and also available for Debian).\n\n## Advanced Setup Tips\n\n### Using HTTPS\n\nTo use Huginn with HTTPS:\n\n1. In `.env`:\n    1. Set the `FORCE_SSL` option to `true`.\n1. Use the `huginn-ssl` Nginx example config instead of the `huginn` config:\n    1. `sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn-ssl /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn`\n    1. Update `YOUR_SERVER_FQDN`.\n    1. Update `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`.\n    1. Review the configuration file and consider applying other security and performance enhancing features.\n\nRestart Nginx, export the init script and restart Huginn:\n\n```\ncd /home/huginn/huginn\nsudo service nginx restart\nsudo bundle exec rake production:export\n```\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate is discouraged, but if you must use it follow the normal directions. Then generate the certificate:\n\n```\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/\ncd /etc/nginx/ssl/\nsudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -days 3560 -out huginn.crt -keyout huginn.key\nsudo chmod o-r huginn.key\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something went wrong during the installation please make sure you followed the instructions and did not miss a step.\n\nWhen your Huginn instance still is not working first run the self check:\n\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:check\n\nWe are sorry when you are still having issues, now please check the various log files for error messages:\n\n#### Nginx error log `/var/log/nginx/huginn_error.log`\n\nThis file should be empty, it is the first place to look because `nginx` is the first application handling the request your are sending to Huginn.\n\nCommon problems:\n\n* `connect() to unix:/home/huginn/huginn/tmp/sockets/unicorn.socket failed`: The Unicorn application server is not running, ensure you uncommented one of the example configuration below the `PRODUCTION` label in your [Procfile](#install-init-script) and the unicorn config file (`/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb`) exists.\n* `138 open() \"/home/huginn/huginn/public/...\" failed (13: Permission denied)`: The `/home/huginn/huginn/public` directory needs to be readable by the nginx user (which is per default `www-data`)\n\n\n#### Unicorn log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/unicorn.log`\n\nShould only contain HTTP request log entries like: `10.0.2.2 - - [18/Aug/2015:21:15:12 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 - 0.0110`\n\nIf you see ruby exception backtraces or other error messages the problem could be one of the following:\n\n* The configuration file `/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb` does not exist\n* Gem dependencies where not [installed](#install-gems)\n\n#### Rails Application log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/production.log`\n\nThis file is pretty verbose, you want to look at it if you are getting the `We're sorry, but something went wrong.` error message when using Huginn. This is an example backtrace that can help you or other huginn developers locate the issue:\n\n```\nNoMethodError (undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass):\n  app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb:6:in `index'\n  config/initializers/silence_worker_status_logger.rb:5:in `call_with_silence_worker_status'\n```\n\n#### Runit/Background Worker logs `/home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current`\n\nThose files will contain error messages or backtraces if one of your agent is not performing as they should. The easiest way to debug an Agent is to watch all your log files for changes and trigger the agent to run via the Huginn web interface.\n\nThe log file location depends your `Procfile` configuration, this command will give you a list of the available logs:\n\n    ls -al /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\nWhen you want to monitor the background processes you can easily watch all the files for changes:\n\n    tail -f /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\n### Still having problems? :crying_cat_face:\n\nYou probably found an error message or exception backtrace you could not resolve. Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues) and include as much information as you could gather about the problem your are experiencing.\n\n\n### Additional notes\n\nDebian Stretch switched from MySQL to [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). All packages with `mysql` in the name are just wrappers around the MariaDB ones, with some containing some compatibility symlinks. Huginn should also work fine with the MariaDB packages directly, although to keep the installation instructions more compact, they still use the MySQL packages.\n\n#### Set password for root MySQL user on Ubuntu\n\nMySQL installations (>= 5.7.26) on Ubuntu use the UNIX `auth_socket` plugin by default, such that authentication is handled by system user credientials. In order to access the MySQL root user from any system user, you have to set the MySQL root user password in the user database. Sign into the MySQL shell \n\n    sudo mysql -u root -p\n\n    # The default password upon installation is blank\n\nOnce in the MySQL shell, run the following command to set the password for the root user by replacing `new-password` with a password of your choice\n\n    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';\n\nAfter the change has been made, exit the MySQL shell with `\\q`. \n\nFor the change to propogate, restart the MySQL server\n\n    sudo service mysql restart\n",

Please read [requirements.md](./requirements.md) for hardware and operating system requirements.\n\nThis is the official installation guide to set up a production server. To set up a **development installation** or for many other installation options please see [the getting started section of the readme](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started).\n\nThe following steps have been known to work. Please **use caution when you deviate** from this guide. Make sure you don't violate any assumptions Huginn makes about its environment. For example many people run into permission problems because they change the location of directories or run services as the wrong user.\n\nIf you find a bug/error in this guide please **submit a pull request**.\n\nIf not stated otherwise all commands should be run as user with sudo permissions or as root.\n\nWhen having problems during the installation please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Huginn installation consists of setting up the following components:\n\n1. Packages / Dependencies\n1. Ruby\n1. System Users\n1. Database\n1. Huginn\n1. Nginx\n\n## 1. Packages / Dependencies\n\n`sudo` is not installed on Debian by default. Make sure your system is\nup-to-date and install it.\n\n    # run as root!\n    apt-get update -y\n    apt-get upgrade -y\n    apt-get install sudo -y\n\n**Note:** During this installation some files will need to be edited manually. If you are familiar with vim set it as default editor with the commands below. If you are not familiar with vim please skip this and keep using the default editor.\n\n    # Install vim and set as default editor\n    sudo apt-get install -y vim\n    sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\nInstall the required packages (needed to compile Ruby and native extensions to Ruby gems):\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit build-essential git zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server checkinstall libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev logrotate pkg-config cmake nodejs graphviz jq shared-mime-info\n\n\n### Debian Stretch\n\nSince Debian Stretch, `runit` isn't started anymore automatically, but this gets handled by the init system. Additionally, Ruby requires the OpenSSL 1.0 development packages instead of 1.1. For a default installation use these packages:\n\n     sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd libssl1.0-dev\n\n### Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic\n\nTo start `runit` automatically on Ubuntu Bionic, we need to install `runit-systemd`:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd\n\n## 2. Ruby\n\nThe use of Ruby version managers such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/), [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with Huginn in production frequently leads to hard-to-diagnose problems. Version managers are not supported and we strongly advise everyone to follow the instructions below to use a system Ruby.\n\nRemove the old Ruby versions if present:\n\n    sudo apt-get remove -y ruby1.8 ruby1.9\n\nDownload Ruby and compile it:\n\n    mkdir /tmp/ruby && cd /tmp/ruby\n    curl -L --progress-bar https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/3.2/ruby-3.2.6.tar.xz | tar xJ\n    cd ruby-3.2.6\n    ./configure --disable-install-rdoc\n    make -j`nproc`\n    sudo make install\n\nInstall foreman:\n\n    sudo gem install foreman --no-document\n\n## 3. System Users\n\nCreate a user for Huginn:\n\n    sudo adduser --disabled-login --gecos 'Huginn' huginn\n\n## 4. Database\n\n### MySQL / MariaDB\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\n\nFor Debian Stretch, replace `libmysqlclient-dev` with `default-libmysqlclient-dev`. See the [additional notes section](#additional-notes) for more information.\n\nFor Debian BullsEye:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev\n\nCheck the installed MySQL version (remember if its >= 5.5.3 for the `.env` configuration done later):\n\n    mysql --version\n\nSecure your installation. During this step, you will be prompted to pick a MySQL root password (can be anything)\n\n    sudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nThe `mysql_secure_installation` script does not apply the user-provided password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems. To apply a password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems, see the [additional notes section](#set-password-for-root-MySQL-user-on-Ubuntu) for more information before proceeding.\n\nLogin to MySQL using the root password you set in the previous steps\n\n    mysql -u root -p\n\n    # Type the MySQL root password\n\nCreate a user for Huginn do not type the `mysql>`, this is part of the prompt. Change `$password` in the command below to a real password you pick\n\n    mysql> CREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\n\nEnsure you can use the InnoDB engine which is necessary to support long indexes\n\n    mysql> SET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n    # If this fails, check your MySQL config files (e.g. `/etc/mysql/*.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/*`)\n    # for the setting \"innodb = off\"\n\nGrant the Huginn user necessary permissions on the database\n\n    mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\nUse the flush privileges command to save the new permissions\n\n    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nQuit the database session\n\n    mysql> \\q\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H mysql -u huginn -p -D huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you replaced $password with earlier\n\nYou should now see `ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'huginn_production'` which is fine because we will create the database later.\n\nYou are done installing the database and can go back to the rest of the installation.\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql libpq-dev\n\nCreate a user for Huginn and set its database connection password. If you want the user to be able to create the database, add `-d`\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createuser -P huginn\n\nCreate a database\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createdb -O huginn -T template0 huginn_production\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn psql -h localhost -W huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you set earlier\n\nYou should now be greeted by the `psql` interactive client and be connected to the `huginn_production` database. Quit the database session with `\\q` or `CTRL-D`\n\n## 5. Huginn\n\n### Clone the Source\n\n    # We'll install Huginn into the home directory of the user \"huginn\"\n    cd /home/huginn\n\n    # Clone Huginn repository\n    sudo -u huginn -H git clone https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git -b master huginn\n\n    # Go to Huginn installation folder\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n\n    # Copy the example Huginn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp .env.example .env\n\n    # Create the log/, tmp/pids/ and tmp/sockets/ directories\n    sudo -u huginn mkdir -p log tmp/pids tmp/sockets\n\n    # Make sure Huginn can write to the log/ and tmp/ directories\n    sudo chown -R huginn log/ tmp/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/ tmp/\n\n    # Make sure permissions are set correctly\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/\n    sudo -u huginn -H chmod o-rwx .env\n\n    # Copy the example Unicorn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp config/unicorn.rb.example config/unicorn.rb\n\n### Configure it\n\n    # Update Huginn config file and follow the instructions\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor .env\n\nIf you are using a local MySQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn MySQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    #DATABASE_HOST=your-domain-here.com\n    #DATABASE_PORT=3306\n    #DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n    # MySQL only: If you are running a MySQL server >=5.5.3, you should\n    # set DATABASE_ENCODING to utf8mb4 instead of utf8 so that the\n    # database can hold 4-byte UTF-8 characters like emoji.\n    #DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4\n\nIf you are using a local PostgreSQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn PostgreSQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    DATABASE_HOST=localhost\n    DATABASE_PORT=5432\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n\n**Important**: Uncomment the RAILS_ENV setting to run Huginn in the production rails environment\n\n    RAILS_ENV=production\n\nChange the Unicorn config if needed, the [requirements.md](./requirements.md#unicorn-workers) has a section explaining the suggested amount of unicorn workers:\n\n    # Increase the amount of workers if you expect to have a high load instance.\n    # 2 are enough for most use cases, if the server has less then 2GB of RAM\n    # decrease the worker amount to 1\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor config/unicorn.rb\n\n\n**Important Note:** Make sure to edit both `.env` and `unicorn.rb` to match your setup.\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\n**Note:** For configuration changes after finishing the initial installation you have to re-export (see [Install Init Script](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/installation.md#install-init-script)) the init script every time you change `.env`, `unicorn.rb` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Install Gems\n\n**Note:** As of bundler 1.5.2, you can invoke `bundle install -jN` (where `N` the number of your processor cores) and enjoy parallel gem installation with measurable difference in completion time (~60% faster). Check the number of your cores with `nproc`. For more information check this [post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler). First make sure you have bundler >= 1.5.2 (run `bundle -v`) as it addresses some [issues](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/411) that were [fixed](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/2817) in 1.5.2.\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle install --deployment --without development test\n\n### Initialize Database\n\n    # Create the database\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Migrate to the latest version\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Create admin user and example agents using the default admin/password login\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n\nWhen done you see `See the Huginn Wiki for more Agent examples!  https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki`\n\n**Note:** This will create an initial user, you can change the username and password by supplying it in environmental variables `SEED_USERNAME` and `SEED_PASSWORD` as seen above. If you don't change the password (and it is set to the default one) please wait with exposing Huginn to the public internet until the installation is done and you've logged into the server and changed your password.\n\n### Compile Assets\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production\n\n### Install Init Script\n\nHuginn uses [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to generate the init scripts based on a `Procfile`\n\nEdit the [`Procfile`](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile) and choose one of the suggested versions for production\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor Procfile\n\nComment out (disable) [these two lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L6-L7)\n\n    web: bundle exec rails server -p ${PORT-3000} -b ${IP-0.0.0.0}\n    jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\nEnable (remove the comment) [from these lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L24-L25) or [those](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L28-L31)\n\n    # web: bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb\n    # jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\n**Note:** Ensure you have no leading spaces before `web:` or `jobs:` in your `Procfile` file.\n\nIf you use a directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/` for the app, change the location of the `runit` logfile in `lib/tasks/production.rake`, for example:\n    run('foreman export runit -a huginn -l /opt/huginn/log /etc/service')\n\nExport the init scripts:\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:export\n\n**Note:** You have to re-export the init script every time you change the configuration in `.env` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Setup Logrotate\n\n    sudo cp deployment/logrotate/huginn /etc/logrotate.d/huginn\n\nChange the location of the log directory if you have chosen to log to a different directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/log/`\n\n### Ensure Your Huginn Instance Is Running\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:status\n\n## 6. Nginx\n\n**Note:** Nginx is the officially supported web server for Huginn. If you cannot or do not want to use Nginx as your web server, the wiki has a page on how to configure [apache](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Apache-Huginn-configuration).\n\n### Installation\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n### Site Configuration\n\nCopy the example site config:\n\n    sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/huginn\n\nMake sure to edit the config file to match your setup, if you are running multiple nginx sites remove the `default_server` argument from the `listen` directives:\n\n    # Change YOUR_SERVER_FQDN to the fully-qualified\n    # domain name of your host serving Huginn.\n    sudo editor /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n\nRemove the default nginx site, **if huginn is the only enabled nginx site**:\n\n    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, replace the `huginn` Nginx config with `huginn-ssl`. See [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for HTTPS configuration details.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nValidate your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file with the following command:\n\n    sudo nginx -t\n\nYou should receive `syntax is okay` and `test is successful` messages. If you receive errors check your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file for typos, etc. as indicated in the error message given.\n\n### Restart\n\n    sudo service nginx restart\n\n# Done!\n\n### Initial Login\n\nVisit YOUR_SERVER in your web browser for your first Huginn login. The setup has created a default admin account for you. You can use it to log in:\n\n    admin (or your SEED_USERNAME)\n    password (or your SEED_PASSWORD)\n\n\n**Enjoy!** :sparkles: :star: :fireworks:\n\nYou can use `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:start` and `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:stop` to start and stop Huginn.\n\nBe sure to read the section about how to [update](./update.md) your Huginn installation as well! You can also use [Capistrano](./capistrano.md) to keep your installation up to date.\n\n**Note:** We also recommend applying standard security practices to your server, including installing a firewall ([ufw](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) is good on Ubuntu and also available for Debian).\n\n## Advanced Setup Tips\n\n### Using HTTPS\n\nTo use Huginn with HTTPS:\n\n1. In `.env`:\n    1. Set the `FORCE_SSL` option to `true`.\n1. Use the `huginn-ssl` Nginx example config instead of the `huginn` config:\n    1. `sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn-ssl /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn`\n    1. Update `YOUR_SERVER_FQDN`.\n    1. Update `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`.\n    1. Review the configuration file and consider applying other security and performance enhancing features.\n\nRestart Nginx, export the init script and restart Huginn:\n\n```\ncd /home/huginn/huginn\nsudo service nginx restart\nsudo bundle exec rake production:export\n```\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate is discouraged, but if you must use it follow the normal directions. Then generate the certificate:\n\n```\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/\ncd /etc/nginx/ssl/\nsudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -days 3560 -out huginn.crt -keyout huginn.key\nsudo chmod o-r huginn.key\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something went wrong during the installation please make sure you followed the instructions and did not miss a step.\n\nWhen your Huginn instance still is not working first run the self check:\n\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:check\n\nWe are sorry when you are still having issues, now please check the various log files for error messages:\n\n#### Nginx error log `/var/log/nginx/huginn_error.log`\n\nThis file should be empty, it is the first place to look because `nginx` is the first application handling the request your are sending to Huginn.\n\nCommon problems:\n\n* `connect() to unix:/home/huginn/huginn/tmp/sockets/unicorn.socket failed`: The Unicorn application server is not running, ensure you uncommented one of the example configuration below the `PRODUCTION` label in your [Procfile](#install-init-script) and the unicorn config file (`/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb`) exists.\n* `138 open() \"/home/huginn/huginn/public/...\" failed (13: Permission denied)`: The `/home/huginn/huginn/public` directory needs to be readable by the nginx user (which is per default `www-data`)\n\n\n#### Unicorn log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/unicorn.log`\n\nShould only contain HTTP request log entries like: `10.0.2.2 - - [18/Aug/2015:21:15:12 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 - 0.0110`\n\nIf you see ruby exception backtraces or other error messages the problem could be one of the following:\n\n* The configuration file `/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb` does not exist\n* Gem dependencies where not [installed](#install-gems)\n\n#### Rails Application log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/production.log`\n\nThis file is pretty verbose, you want to look at it if you are getting the `We're sorry, but something went wrong.` error message when using Huginn. This is an example backtrace that can help you or other huginn developers locate the issue:\n\n```\nNoMethodError (undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass):\n  app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb:6:in `index'\n  config/initializers/silence_worker_status_logger.rb:5:in `call_with_silence_worker_status'\n```\n\n#### Runit/Background Worker logs `/home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current`\n\nThose files will contain error messages or backtraces if one of your agent is not performing as they should. The easiest way to debug an Agent is to watch all your log files for changes and trigger the agent to run via the Huginn web interface.\n\nThe log file location depends your `Procfile` configuration, this command will give you a list of the available logs:\n\n    ls -al /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\nWhen you want to monitor the background processes you can easily watch all the files for changes:\n\n    tail -f /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\n### Still having problems? :crying_cat_face:\n\nYou probably found an error message or exception backtrace you could not resolve. Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues) and include as much information as you could gather about the problem your are experiencing.\n\n\n### Additional notes\n\nDebian Stretch switched from MySQL to [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). All packages with `mysql` in the name are just wrappers around the MariaDB ones, with some containing some compatibility symlinks. Huginn should also work fine with the MariaDB packages directly, although to keep the installation instructions more compact, they still use the MySQL packages.\n\n#### Set password for root MySQL user on Ubuntu\n\nMySQL installations (>= 5.7.26) on Ubuntu use the UNIX `auth_socket` plugin by default, such that authentication is handled by system user credientials. In order to access the MySQL root user from any system user, you have to set the MySQL root user password in the user database. Sign into the MySQL shell \n\n    sudo mysql -u root -p\n\n    # The default password upon installation is blank\n\nOnce in the MySQL shell, run the following command to set the password for the root user by replacing `new-password` with a password of your choice\n\n    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';\n\nAfter the change has been made, exit the MySQL shell with `\\q`. \n\nFor the change to propogate, restart the MySQL server\n\n    sudo service mysql restart\n",

[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Authentication System Overview\n\nHuginn implements a multi-layered authentication system:\n\n- **Session-based authentication** for web interface (using Devise)\n- **Secret-based authentication** for webhook endpoints\n- **User-scoped authorization** for all resources\n- **OAuth integration** for external services\n- **Invitation code system** for user registration\n\n### Core Security Principles\n\n- All resources are scoped to the authenticated user\n- Webhook endpoints require secret validation\n- CSRF protection for state-changing operations\n- OAuth integration for external service authentication\n- Account lockout protection against brute force attacks\n\n## Web Interface Authentication\n\n### Devise Configuration\n\nHuginn uses Devise with the following modules:\n\n```ruby\ndevise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,\n       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable,\n       :validatable, :lockable, :omniauthable,\n       *(:confirmable if ENV['REQUIRE_CONFIRMED_EMAIL'] == 'true')\n```\n\n### Authentication Features\n\n- **Username or Email Login**: Users can authenticate with either username or email\n- **Account Locking**: Configurable failed attempt limits (default: 10 attempts)\n- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters (configurable via `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH`)\n- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts\n- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent sessions with secure cookies in production\n\n### User Registration\n\nRegistration requires an invitation code system:\n\n```ruby\n# Environment configuration\nINVITATION_CODES = [ENV['INVITATION_CODE'] || 'try-huginn']\n\n# Skip invitation code requirement (development)\nENV['SKIP_INVITATION_CODE'] != 'true'\n```\n\n### Session Security\n\n**Production Configuration:**\n```ruby\n# Secure cookies in production\nconfig.rememberable_options = { secure: true }\n\n# Force SSL (optional)\nconfig.force_ssl = ENV['FORCE_SSL'] == 'true'\n```\n\n## Webhook Authentication\n\n### Web Request Endpoints\n\nHuginn provides webhook endpoints that bypass session authentication:\n\n```\nPOST/GET/PUT/DELETE /users/:user_id/web_requests/:agent_id/:secret\n```\n\n### Security Implementation\n\nThe `WebRequestsController` implements security through:\n\n```ruby\nclass WebRequestsController < ApplicationController\n  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token  # CSRF not applicable to webhooks\n  skip_before_action :authenticate_user!         # Uses secret-based auth instead\n  \n  def handle_request\n    user = User.find_by_id(params[:user_id])\n    agent = user.agents.find_by_id(params[:agent_id])\n    # Secret validation happens in agent's receive_web_request method\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Secret Validation Pattern\n\nEach agent that receives webhooks validates the secret:\n\n```ruby\n# Example from WebhookAgent\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  secret = request.path_parameters[:secret]\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless secret == interpolated['secret']\n  # Process request...\nend\n```\n\n### Secret Generation\n\nSecrets are typically generated using secure random values:\n\n```ruby\ndef default_options\n  {\n    \"secret\" => SecureRandom.uuid,\n    # other options...\n  }\nend\n```\n\n## API Endpoint Security\n\n### Resource-Scoped Authorization\n\nAll API endpoints enforce user-based authorization:\n\n**Agents Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef index\n  @agents = current_user.agents.page(params[:page])\nend\n\ndef show\n  @agent = current_user.agents.find(params[:id])\nend\n```\n\n**Events Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef index\n  @events = current_user.events.preload(:agent).page(params[:page])\nend\n```\n\n**Scenarios Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef show\n  @scenario = current_user.scenarios.find(params[:id])\nend\n```\n\n### Authentication Requirements\n\n| Endpoint | Authentication | Authorization |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|\n| `/agents` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/events` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/scenarios` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/scenarios/:id/export` | Optional* | Public scenarios or owner |\n| `/web_requests/:user_id/:agent_id/:secret` | Secret-based | Agent secret validation |\n\n*Public scenarios can be exported without authentication\n\n## Security Patterns\n\n### CSRF Protection\n\n**Default Protection:**\n```ruby\n# ApplicationController\nbefore_action :verify_authenticity_token  # Applied to all controllers\n```\n\n**Selective Bypass:**\n```ruby\n# WebRequestsController (webhooks don't need CSRF protection)\nskip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token\n```\n\n### Input Sanitization\n\n**HTML Sanitization:**\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = %w[strong em b i p code pre ...]\nconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_attributes = %w[href src width height ...]\n```\n\n### Parameter Security\n\n**Strong Parameters:**\n```ruby\ndef agent_params\n  params[:agent].permit([:memory, :name, :type, :schedule, :disabled, \n                        :keep_events_for, :propagate_immediately, \n                        source_ids: [], receiver_ids: [], \n                        scenario_ids: []] + agent_params_options)\nend\n```\n\n### reCAPTCHA Integration\n\nWebhook agents can optionally integrate reCAPTCHA:\n\n```ruby\n# WebhookAgent reCAPTCHA validation\nif recaptcha_secret = interpolated['recaptcha_secret'].presence\n  # Validate reCAPTCHA response\n  response = faraday.post('https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify', {\n    secret: recaptcha_secret,\n    response: params.delete('g-recaptcha-response')\n  })\n  \n  body = JSON.parse(response.body)\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless body['success']\nend\n```\n\n### OAuth Security\n\nExternal service authentication uses OAuth with secure token storage:\n\n```ruby\n# Service model for OAuth tokens\nclass Service < ActiveRecord::Base\n  validates_presence_of :token\n  \n  def refresh_token!\n    # Secure token refresh implementation\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Secret Management\n\n**Generate Strong Secrets:**\n```ruby\n# Use cryptographically secure random values\nsecret = SecureRandom.uuid\nsecret = SecureRandom.hex(32)  # For longer secrets\n```\n\n**Secret Rotation:**\n- Regularly rotate webhook secrets\n- Update secrets in both Huginn and external services\n- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts\n\n### 2. User Credentials\n\n**Secure Storage:**\n```ruby\n# UserCredential model enforces validation\nvalidates :credential_name, presence: true, uniqueness: { scope: :user_id }\nvalidates :credential_value, presence: true\n```\n\n**Access Patterns:**\n```ruby\n# Agents access credentials securely\ndef credential(name)\n  user.user_credentials.where(credential_name: name).first&.credential_value\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Production Security\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n```bash\n# Essential security environment variables\nINVITATION_CODE=your-secure-invitation-code\nMIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=8\nFORCE_SSL=true\nRAILS_MASTER_KEY=your-master-key\n\n# OAuth credentials\nTWITTER_OAUTH_KEY=your-key\nTWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET=your-secret\n```\n\n**SSL/TLS Configuration:**\n```ruby\n# Force SSL in production\nconfig.force_ssl = true\n\n# Secure cookie configuration\nconfig.rememberable_options = { secure: true }\n```\n\n### 4. Webhook Security\n\n**Validate All Requests:**\n```ruby\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  # Always validate secret first\n  secret = request.path_parameters[:secret]\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless secret == expected_secret\n  \n  # Validate HTTP method\n  allowed_methods = %w[post get put delete]\n  return [\"Method Not Allowed\", 405] unless allowed_methods.include?(request.method.downcase)\n  \n  # Process request...\nend\n```\n\n**IP Whitelisting (optional):**\n```ruby\n# In webhook agents, optionally validate source IP\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  allowed_ips = %w[192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8]\n  client_ip = request.remote_ip\n  return [\"Forbidden\", 403] unless ip_allowed?(client_ip, allowed_ips)\nend\n```\n\n## Common Errors and Solutions\n\n### Authentication Errors\n\n**Error: \"Invalid login or password\"**\n- **Cause**: Incorrect username/email or password\n- **Solution**: Verify credentials, check account lockout status\n\n**Error: \"Account is locked\"**\n- **Cause**: Exceeded maximum failed login attempts\n- **Solution**: Wait for unlock timeout or contact admin for manual unlock\n\n**Error: \"Not Authorized\" (401) on webhooks**\n- **Cause**: Invalid or missing secret in webhook URL\n- **Solution**: Verify secret matches agent configuration\n\n### Authorization Errors\n\n**Error: \"Agent not found\" (404)**\n- **Cause**: Agent ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to user\n- **Solution**: Verify agent ownership and ID correctness\n\n**Error: \"Scenario not found\" (404)**\n- **Cause**: Scenario ID doesn't exist or user lacks access\n- **Solution**: Check scenario ownership or public status\n\n### CSRF Errors\n\n**Error: \"Invalid authenticity token\"**\n- **Cause**: Missing or invalid CSRF token in form submission\n- **Solution**: Ensure forms include `<%= csrf_meta_tags %>` and proper token handling\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Webhook Setup\n\n**Agent Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"abc123-secure-secret-xyz789\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n    \"response\": \"Event received\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-instance.com/users/1/web_requests/123/abc123-secure-secret-xyz789\n```\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://your-huginn-instance.com/users/1/web_requests/123/abc123-secure-secret-xyz789 \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello from external service\"}'\n```\n\n### 2. API Authentication\n\n**Session-based API Request:**\n```bash\n# Login first to establish session\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn-instance.com/users/sign_in \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"user\": {\"login\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\"}}' \\\n  -c cookies.txt\n\n# Make authenticated API request\ncurl -X GET https://your-huginn-instance.com/agents.json \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -b cookies.txt\n```\n\n### 3. OAuth Service Integration\n\n**Service Creation Flow:**\n1. User initiates OAuth flow: `/auth/twitter`\n2. External service redirects back: `/auth/twitter/callback`\n3. Huginn creates/updates service record with tokens\n4. Agents can use service for authenticated requests\n\n### 4. User Credential Management\n\n**Creating Credentials:**\n```ruby\n# Via web interface or programmatically\nuser.user_credentials.create!(\n  credential_name: \"api_key\", \n  credential_value: \"secret-api-key-value\"\n)\n```\n\n**Using Credentials in Agents:**\n```ruby\ndef check\n  api_key = credential(\"api_key\")\n  return error(\"API key not found\") unless api_key\n  \n  # Use api_key for external service requests\nend\n```\n\n## Security Monitoring\n\n### Logging\n\nHuginn logs authentication events and security-relevant activities:\n\n- Failed login attempts\n- Account lockouts\n- Webhook request processing\n- Agent execution errors\n\n### Monitoring Recommendations\n\n1. **Monitor failed authentication attempts**\n2. **Set up alerts for account lockouts**\n3. **Track webhook endpoint access patterns**\n4. **Review agent logs for security errors**\n5. **Monitor OAuth token refresh activities**\n\n---\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to Huginn's authentication and security systems.

Authentication\n\nMost API endpoints require session-based authentication through Devise. Login through the web interface first to establish a session, then use the session cookie in your API requests.\n\n```bash\n# Login first through web interface, then use the session cookie\ncurl -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session-cookie\" \\\n     https://your-huginn.com/agents\n```\n\n### 2. Webhooks (No Authentication Required)\n\nWebhook endpoints use secret-based authentication and don't require sessions:\n\n```bash\n# Send webhook data to an agent\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/your-secret \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"event\": \"user_signup\", \"email\": \"user@example.com\"}'\n```\n\n### 3. Common Operations\n\n#### List Your Agents\n```bash\nGET /agents\n```\n\n#### Create a WebhookAgent\n```bash\nPOST /agents\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Webhook Agent\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"my-secret-token\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get RSS Feed from DataOutputAgent\n```bash\nGET /users/1/web_requests/456/feed-secret?format=xml\n```\n\n## API Specification\n\nThe complete API specification is available in OpenAPI 3.0 format at `openapi.yaml`. You can:\n\n1. **View in Swagger UI**: Import the YAML file into [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)\n2. **Generate Client Libraries**: Use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to create client libraries in your preferred language\n3. **Import into Postman**: Import the OpenAPI spec directly into Postman for testing\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Webhook System\n- **Multiple HTTP Verbs**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- **Secret Authentication**: Each agent uses a configurable secret token\n- **Flexible Payloads**: JSON, form data, and multipart support\n- **Custom Responses**: Agents can return custom content and HTTP status codes\n\n### Agent Management\n- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete agents\n- **Runtime Control**: Manually run agents, clear memory, re-emit events\n- **Type Discovery**: Get agent type details and validation\n- **Scenario Organization**: Group agents into scenarios\n\n### Event Handling\n- **Event Streams**: Monitor events across all agents\n- **Re-emission**: Re-trigger events for downstream processing\n- **Filtering**: Filter events by agent or time period\n\n### Background Jobs\n- **Job Monitoring**: View delayed job queue (admin only)\n- **Job Control**: Retry, delete, or manually run jobs\n- **System Status**: Monitor worker health and performance\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Secret Tokens**: Use strong, unique secrets for webhook agents\n2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting for API calls\n4. **Validation**: Validate all webhook payloads in your agents\n5. **Secrets Management**: Store API secrets securely, not in code\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes:\n\n- **200/201**: Success\n- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid session or secret)\n- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)\n- **404**: Not Found\n- **422**: Validation Error\n- **500**: Server Error\n\nError responses include descriptive messages in the response body.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee `integration-guide.md` for detailed examples and integration patterns for common use cases including:\n\n- Setting up webhook endpoints\n- Creating data processing pipelines  \n- Building RSS/JSON feeds\n- Integrating with external services\n- Monitoring and alerting\n\n## Support\n\nFor questions and support:\n\n- **Documentation**: [Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki)\n- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues)\n- **Community**: [Huginn Discussions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/discussions)"

    "content": "# Huginn Webhook Usage Examples and Patterns\n\nThis comprehensive guide provides production-ready examples for using webhooks in Huginn, covering both WebhookAgent (incoming webhooks) and DataOutputAgent (outgoing data feeds).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [WebhookAgent Examples](#webhookagent-examples)\n- [DataOutputAgent Examples](#dataoutputagent-examples) \n- [Real-World Integration Scenarios](#real-world-integration-scenarios)\n- [Code Examples](#code-examples)\n- [Advanced Patterns](#advanced-patterns)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Testing and Validation](#testing-and-validation)\n\n## WebhookAgent Examples\n\nThe WebhookAgent creates events by receiving HTTP requests (webhooks) from external sources.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"your-secure-random-token-here\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL Format:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n### 1. GitHub Webhook Integration\n\nPerfect for monitoring repository events, pull requests, and issues.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret-xyz789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-GitHub-Event,X-GitHub-Delivery,User-Agent\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"github_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Webhook received successfully\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### GitHub Webhook Setup\n1. Go to your repository's Settings → Webhooks\n2. Add webhook with URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/github-webhook-secret-xyz789`\n3. Select \"application/json\" content type\n4. Choose events: Push, Pull requests, Issues\n\n#### Sample Payload Processing\nThe webhook will create events with this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"opened\",\n  \"pull_request\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix critical bug in authentication\",\n    \"user\": {\"login\": \"developer\"},\n    \"base\": {\"ref\": \"main\"},\n    \"head\": {\"ref\": \"fix/auth-bug\"}\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"name\": \"my-project\",\n    \"full_name\": \"org/my-project\"\n  },\n  \"github_headers\": {\n    \"X-GitHub-Event\": \"pull_request\",\n    \"X-GitHub-Delivery\": \"unique-delivery-id\",\n    \"User-Agent\": \"GitHub-Hookshot/abc123\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Slack Webhook Integration\n\nReceive notifications and commands from Slack.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"slack-webhook-token-abc123\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"User-Agent,X-Slack-Signature\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"slack_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Message processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Slack App Setup\n1. Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps\n2. Enable Event Subscriptions\n3. Set Request URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/slack-webhook-token-abc123`\n4. Subscribe to events: `message.channels`, `app_mention`\n\n### 3. IoT Device Data Collection\n\nCollect sensor data from IoT devices or services.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"iot-sensor-key-def456\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"sensor_data\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-Device-ID,X-Sensor-Type\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"device_info\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,put\",\n  \"response\": \"Data recorded\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Expected JSON Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-03T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"device_id\": \"temp-sensor-01\",\n  \"sensor_data\": {\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"battery_level\": 87,\n    \"location\": {\n      \"latitude\": 40.7128,\n      \"longitude\": -74.0060\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Multiple Event Creation from Arrays\n\nProcess webhooks that contain arrays of data, creating separate events for each item.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"batch-processor-ghi789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"items\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"{{items.size}} events created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Input Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"batch_id\": \"batch_20250903_001\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Product A\", \"price\": 29.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Product B\", \"price\": 39.99},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Product C\", \"price\": 19.99}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create 3 separate events, one for each item in the array.\n\n### 5. Custom Response Headers and CORS\n\nEnable cross-origin requests with custom response headers.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"cors-enabled-webhook-jkl012\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,options\",\n  \"response\": \"Success\",\n  \"code\": \"200\",\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n    \"Access-Control-Max-Age\": \"86400\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nAdd bot protection to your webhooks using Google reCAPTCHA.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"protected-webhook-mno345\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n  \"response\": \"Verified and processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n## DataOutputAgent Examples\n\nThe DataOutputAgent outputs received events as RSS or JSON feeds accessible via HTTP.\n\n### Basic RSS Feed Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"rss-feed-token-abc123\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"My Huginn Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest events from my Huginn agents\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-blog.com\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 50,\n  \"ttl\": 60\n}\n```\n\n**Access URLs:**\n- RSS: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.xml`\n- JSON: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.json`\n\n### 1.

Webhook Chaining and Event Flow\n\nCreate complex workflows by chaining multiple webhook endpoints.\n\n#### Primary Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Initial Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-start-abc123\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Processing initiated\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Processing Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Processor\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    // Add processing metadata\\n    var processed = {\\n      original_data: event,\\n      processed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_id: 'proc_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),\\n      status: 'processed'\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(processed);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Notification Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Notification Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-notify-def456\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Notification sent\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Data Transformation Pipelines\n\nTransform incoming data through multiple stages.\n\n#### Schema Validation Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Schema Validator\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var isValid = true;\\n    var errors = [];\\n    \\n    // Validate required fields\\n    if (!event.user_id) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing user_id');\\n    }\\n    \\n    if (!event.timestamp) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing timestamp');\\n    }\\n    \\n    var result = {\\n      original_event: event,\\n      validation: {\\n        is_valid: isValid,\\n        errors: errors,\\n        validated_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      }\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(result);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Data Enrichment Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Enricher\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    if (event.validation.is_valid) {\\n      var enriched = event.original_event;\\n      \\n      // Add computed fields\\n      enriched.day_of_week = new Date(enriched.timestamp).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {weekday: 'long'});\\n      enriched.hour_of_day = new Date(enriched.timestamp).getHours();\\n      enriched.enriched_at = new Date().toISOString();\\n      \\n      this.createEvent(enriched);\\n    } else {\\n      console.log('Skipping invalid event:', event.validation.errors);\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImplement robust error handling for webhook processing.\n\n#### Error Capture Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Error Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    try {\\n      // Attempt processing\\n      var processed = processData(event);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'success',\\n        data: processed,\\n        processed_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      });\\n      \\n    } catch (error) {\\n      // Log error and create error event\\n      console.log('Processing error:', error.message);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'error',\\n        error_message: error.message,\\n        original_event: event,\\n        failed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n        retry_count: event.retry_count || 0\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n  \\n  function processData(data) {\\n    // Your processing logic here\\n    if (!data.required_field) {\\n      throw new Error('Missing required field');\\n    }\\n    return { processed: true, result: data.required_field.toUpperCase() };\\n  }\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Retry Logic Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Retry Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::TriggerAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rules\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field==value\",\n        \"value\": \"error\",\n        \"path\": \"status\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field<value\",\n        \"value\": \"3\",\n        \"path\": \"retry_count\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"message\": \"Retrying failed event (attempt {{retry_count + 1}})\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Logging Practices\n\nImplement comprehensive monitoring for your webhook infrastructure.\n\n#### Metrics Collection Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Metrics\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var metrics = {\\n      event_type: event.type || 'unknown',\\n      source: event.headers ? event.headers['User-Agent'] : 'unknown',\\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_time: Date.now() - new Date(event.received_at || event.created_at).getTime(),\\n      payload_size: JSON.stringify(event).length,\\n      success: true\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(metrics);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Log Aggregation Feed\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Logs Feed\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"webhook-logs-vwx234\"],\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"Webhook Processing Logs\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time webhook processing metrics and logs\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{event_type}} from {{source}}\",\n        \"description\": \"Processing time: {{processing_time}}ms | Size: {{payload_size}} bytes\",\n        \"category\": \"{{success ? 'success' : 'error'}}\",\n        \"processing_time\": \"{{processing_time}}\",\n        \"payload_size\": \"{{payload_size}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"events_to_show\": 500\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" Error (401)\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect secret in URL or webhook configuration\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret matches exactly between webhook URL and agent configuration\n- Check for leading/trailing spaces in the secret\n- Ensure the secret doesn't contain special characters that need URL encoding\n- Test with a simple secret like `test123` first\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}' -v\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" Error (404)\n\n**Cause:** Invalid agent ID or user ID in URL\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the agent ID in your Huginn dashboard\n- Ensure the user ID is correct\n- Check that the agent is active and not deleted\n\n#### 3. Events Not Being Created\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n**Incorrect `payload_path`:**\n```json\n// If your JSON is: {\"data\": {\"items\": [1,2,3]}}\n// Use payload_path: \"data.items\" to create 3 events\n// Use payload_path: \"data\" to create 1 event with the data object\n// Use payload_path: \".\" to create 1 event with entire payload\n```\n\n**HTTP Method Not Allowed:**\n```json\n{\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get,put\"  // Specify allowed HTTP methods\n}\n```\n\n**Payload Processing Errors:**\n- Check agent logs for error messages\n- Verify JSON structure matches expected format\n- Test with simplified payloads first\n\n#### 4. RSS/JSON Feed Not Loading\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect feed URL or secret\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret is in the `secrets` array\n- Check the feed URL format: `/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}`\n- Test the agent has received events recently\n- Verify `expected_receive_period_in_days` hasn't expired\n\n#### 5. CORS Issues with Browser Requests\n\n**Solution:** Add CORS headers to webhook response\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, GET, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 6. Large Payloads Causing Timeouts\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Break large payloads into smaller chunks\n- Use `payload_path` to extract specific data portions\n- Implement pagination for data feeds\n- Consider using background job processing\n\n#### 7. reCAPTCHA Verification Failing\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- Wrong reCAPTCHA secret key\n- Missing `g-recaptcha-response` in payload\n- Score threshold too high for reCAPTCHA v3\n\n**Solution:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-secret-key-from-google\",\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.3,  // Lower threshold for more lenient verification\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n#### 1. Test with Simple Payload\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secret \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"hello\"}' \\\n  -v\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Agent Logs\n- Go to your agent's page in Huginn\n- Click on \"Logs\" tab\n- Look for error messages and processing information\n\n#### 3. Verify Event Creation\n- Check the agent's \"Events\" tab\n- Look for recently created events\n- Verify event payload structure\n\n#### 4. Test Feed URLs\n```bash\n# Test RSS feed\ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.xml -v\n\n# Test JSON feed  \ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.json -v\n```\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### WebhookAgent Testing\n\n#### 1.

    "content": "# Huginn Webhook Usage Examples and Patterns\n\nThis comprehensive guide provides production-ready examples for using webhooks in Huginn, covering both WebhookAgent (incoming webhooks) and DataOutputAgent (outgoing data feeds).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [WebhookAgent Examples](#webhookagent-examples)\n- [DataOutputAgent Examples](#dataoutputagent-examples) \n- [Real-World Integration Scenarios](#real-world-integration-scenarios)\n- [Code Examples](#code-examples)\n- [Advanced Patterns](#advanced-patterns)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Testing and Validation](#testing-and-validation)\n\n## WebhookAgent Examples\n\nThe WebhookAgent creates events by receiving HTTP requests (webhooks) from external sources.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"your-secure-random-token-here\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL Format:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n### 1. GitHub Webhook Integration\n\nPerfect for monitoring repository events, pull requests, and issues.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret-xyz789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-GitHub-Event,X-GitHub-Delivery,User-Agent\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"github_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Webhook received successfully\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### GitHub Webhook Setup\n1. Go to your repository's Settings → Webhooks\n2. Add webhook with URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/github-webhook-secret-xyz789`\n3. Select \"application/json\" content type\n4. Choose events: Push, Pull requests, Issues\n\n#### Sample Payload Processing\nThe webhook will create events with this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"opened\",\n  \"pull_request\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix critical bug in authentication\",\n    \"user\": {\"login\": \"developer\"},\n    \"base\": {\"ref\": \"main\"},\n    \"head\": {\"ref\": \"fix/auth-bug\"}\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"name\": \"my-project\",\n    \"full_name\": \"org/my-project\"\n  },\n  \"github_headers\": {\n    \"X-GitHub-Event\": \"pull_request\",\n    \"X-GitHub-Delivery\": \"unique-delivery-id\",\n    \"User-Agent\": \"GitHub-Hookshot/abc123\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Slack Webhook Integration\n\nReceive notifications and commands from Slack.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"slack-webhook-token-abc123\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"User-Agent,X-Slack-Signature\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"slack_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Message processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Slack App Setup\n1. Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps\n2. Enable Event Subscriptions\n3. Set Request URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/slack-webhook-token-abc123`\n4. Subscribe to events: `message.channels`, `app_mention`\n\n### 3. IoT Device Data Collection\n\nCollect sensor data from IoT devices or services.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"iot-sensor-key-def456\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"sensor_data\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-Device-ID,X-Sensor-Type\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"device_info\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,put\",\n  \"response\": \"Data recorded\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Expected JSON Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-03T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"device_id\": \"temp-sensor-01\",\n  \"sensor_data\": {\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"battery_level\": 87,\n    \"location\": {\n      \"latitude\": 40.7128,\n      \"longitude\": -74.0060\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Multiple Event Creation from Arrays\n\nProcess webhooks that contain arrays of data, creating separate events for each item.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"batch-processor-ghi789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"items\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"{{items.size}} events created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Input Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"batch_id\": \"batch_20250903_001\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Product A\", \"price\": 29.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Product B\", \"price\": 39.99},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Product C\", \"price\": 19.99}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create 3 separate events, one for each item in the array.\n\n### 5. Custom Response Headers and CORS\n\nEnable cross-origin requests with custom response headers.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"cors-enabled-webhook-jkl012\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,options\",\n  \"response\": \"Success\",\n  \"code\": \"200\",\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n    \"Access-Control-Max-Age\": \"86400\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nAdd bot protection to your webhooks using Google reCAPTCHA.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"protected-webhook-mno345\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n  \"response\": \"Verified and processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n## DataOutputAgent Examples\n\nThe DataOutputAgent outputs received events as RSS or JSON feeds accessible via HTTP.\n\n### Basic RSS Feed Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"rss-feed-token-abc123\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"My Huginn Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest events from my Huginn agents\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-blog.com\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 50,\n  \"ttl\": 60\n}\n```\n\n**Access URLs:**\n- RSS: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.xml`\n- JSON: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.json`\n\n### 1. News Feed Aggregator\n\nCreate RSS feed from multiple news sources.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"news-aggregator-xyz789\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"Tech News Aggregator\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest technology news from multiple sources\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-tech-blog.com\",\n    \"icon\": \"https://my-tech-blog.com/favicon.ico\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{summary}} Source: {{source}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{published_at}}\",\n      \"author\": \"{{author}}\",\n      \"category\": \"{{category}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 100,\n  \"ttl\": 30,\n  \"ns_media\": true,\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Cache-Control\": \"public, max-age=1800\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

Webhook Chaining and Event Flow\n\nCreate complex workflows by chaining multiple webhook endpoints.\n\n#### Primary Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Initial Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-start-abc123\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Processing initiated\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Processing Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Processor\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    // Add processing metadata\\n    var processed = {\\n      original_data: event,\\n      processed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_id: 'proc_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),\\n      status: 'processed'\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(processed);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Notification Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Notification Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-notify-def456\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Notification sent\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Data Transformation Pipelines\n\nTransform incoming data through multiple stages.\n\n#### Schema Validation Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Schema Validator\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var isValid = true;\\n    var errors = [];\\n    \\n    // Validate required fields\\n    if (!event.user_id) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing user_id');\\n    }\\n    \\n    if (!event.timestamp) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing timestamp');\\n    }\\n    \\n    var result = {\\n      original_event: event,\\n      validation: {\\n        is_valid: isValid,\\n        errors: errors,\\n        validated_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      }\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(result);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Data Enrichment Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Enricher\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    if (event.validation.is_valid) {\\n      var enriched = event.original_event;\\n      \\n      // Add computed fields\\n      enriched.day_of_week = new Date(enriched.timestamp).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {weekday: 'long'});\\n      enriched.hour_of_day = new Date(enriched.timestamp).getHours();\\n      enriched.enriched_at = new Date().toISOString();\\n      \\n      this.createEvent(enriched);\\n    } else {\\n      console.log('Skipping invalid event:', event.validation.errors);\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImplement robust error handling for webhook processing.\n\n#### Error Capture Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Error Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    try {\\n      // Attempt processing\\n      var processed = processData(event);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'success',\\n        data: processed,\\n        processed_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      });\\n      \\n    } catch (error) {\\n      // Log error and create error event\\n      console.log('Processing error:', error.message);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'error',\\n        error_message: error.message,\\n        original_event: event,\\n        failed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n        retry_count: event.retry_count || 0\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n  \\n  function processData(data) {\\n    // Your processing logic here\\n    if (!data.required_field) {\\n      throw new Error('Missing required field');\\n    }\\n    return { processed: true, result: data.required_field.toUpperCase() };\\n  }\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Retry Logic Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Retry Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::TriggerAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rules\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field==value\",\n        \"value\": \"error\",\n        \"path\": \"status\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field<value\",\n        \"value\": \"3\",\n        \"path\": \"retry_count\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"message\": \"Retrying failed event (attempt {{retry_count + 1}})\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Logging Practices\n\nImplement comprehensive monitoring for your webhook infrastructure.\n\n#### Metrics Collection Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Metrics\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var metrics = {\\n      event_type: event.type || 'unknown',\\n      source: event.headers ? event.headers['User-Agent'] : 'unknown',\\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_time: Date.now() - new Date(event.received_at || event.created_at).getTime(),\\n      payload_size: JSON.stringify(event).length,\\n      success: true\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(metrics);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Log Aggregation Feed\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Logs Feed\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"webhook-logs-vwx234\"],\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"Webhook Processing Logs\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time webhook processing metrics and logs\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{event_type}} from {{source}}\",\n        \"description\": \"Processing time: {{processing_time}}ms | Size: {{payload_size}} bytes\",\n        \"category\": \"{{success ? 'success' : 'error'}}\",\n        \"processing_time\": \"{{processing_time}}\",\n        \"payload_size\": \"{{payload_size}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"events_to_show\": 500\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" Error (401)\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect secret in URL or webhook configuration\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret matches exactly between webhook URL and agent configuration\n- Check for leading/trailing spaces in the secret\n- Ensure the secret doesn't contain special characters that need URL encoding\n- Test with a simple secret like `test123` first\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}' -v\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" Error (404)\n\n**Cause:** Invalid agent ID or user ID in URL\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the agent ID in your Huginn dashboard\n- Ensure the user ID is correct\n- Check that the agent is active and not deleted\n\n#### 3. Events Not Being Created\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n**Incorrect `payload_path`:**\n```json\n// If your JSON is: {\"data\": {\"items\": [1,2,3]}}\n// Use payload_path: \"data.items\" to create 3 events\n// Use payload_path: \"data\" to create 1 event with the data object\n// Use payload_path: \".\" to create 1 event with entire payload\n```\n\n**HTTP Method Not Allowed:**\n```json\n{\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get,put\"  // Specify allowed HTTP methods\n}\n```\n\n**Payload Processing Errors:**\n- Check agent logs for error messages\n- Verify JSON structure matches expected format\n- Test with simplified payloads first\n\n#### 4. RSS/JSON Feed Not Loading\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect feed URL or secret\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret is in the `secrets` array\n- Check the feed URL format: `/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}`\n- Test the agent has received events recently\n- Verify `expected_receive_period_in_days` hasn't expired\n\n#### 5. CORS Issues with Browser Requests\n\n**Solution:** Add CORS headers to webhook response\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, GET, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 6. Large Payloads Causing Timeouts\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Break large payloads into smaller chunks\n- Use `payload_path` to extract specific data portions\n- Implement pagination for data feeds\n- Consider using background job processing\n\n#### 7. reCAPTCHA Verification Failing\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- Wrong reCAPTCHA secret key\n- Missing `g-recaptcha-response` in payload\n- Score threshold too high for reCAPTCHA v3\n\n**Solution:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-secret-key-from-google\",\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.3,  // Lower threshold for more lenient verification\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n#### 1. Test with Simple Payload\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secret \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"hello\"}' \\\n  -v\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Agent Logs\n- Go to your agent's page in Huginn\n- Click on \"Logs\" tab\n- Look for error messages and processing information\n\n#### 3. Verify Event Creation\n- Check the agent's \"Events\" tab\n- Look for recently created events\n- Verify event payload structure\n\n#### 4. Test Feed URLs\n```bash\n# Test RSS feed\ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.xml -v\n\n# Test JSON feed  \ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.json -v\n```\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### WebhookAgent Testing\n\n#### 1.
