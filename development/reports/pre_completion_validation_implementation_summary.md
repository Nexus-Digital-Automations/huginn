## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern:** Individual validators implement common interface
2. **Observer Pattern:** Detailed logging and progress reporting
3. **Factory Pattern:** Configuration-based validator instantiation
4. **Template Method:** Consistent validation workflow across components

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation
- Detailed error logging with context information
- Validation continues despite individual component failures
- Clear error reporting with actionable recommendations

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead during validation execution
- Efficient memory usage with garbage collection monitoring
- Concurrent validation where possible
- Configurable timeout and resource limits

### Security Implementation

- Input validation and sanitization throughout
- Secure default configurations
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Security-focused validation criteria

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```ruby
require 'quality_gates/pre_completion'

config = {
  feature_name: 'User Authentication',
  acceptance_criteria: [
    'User can register with valid credentials',
    'User receives email confirmation',
    'User can login after confirmation'
  ],
  performance_targets: {
    response_time: 200,
    memory_usage: 100
  },
  security_requirements: {
    authentication: true,
    authorization: true
  },
  rollback_strategy: {
    database_migrations: true,
    rollback_timeout: 300
  }
}

validator = QualityGates::PreCompletion.new(config)
result = validator.validate_all

puts result.success? ? "✅ Ready for deployment" : "❌ Issues found"
```
