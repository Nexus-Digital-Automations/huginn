## 🎚️ Quality Gate Thresholds

### Production-Ready Standards

| Metric | Threshold | Enforcement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Code Coverage** | 85% minimum | Hard gate - blocks deployment |
| **Response Time** | <200ms | Hard gate - blocks deployment |
| **Error Rate** | <0.1% | Hard gate - blocks deployment |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Zero critical/high | Hard gate - blocks deployment |
| **Overall Quality Score** | 75/100 minimum | Hard gate - blocks deployment |
| **Test Success Rate** | 95% minimum | Hard gate - blocks deployment |

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Overall Quality Score = (
  Code Quality × 20% +
  Test Success × 30% + 
  Coverage × 25% +
  Performance × 10% +
  Security × 15%
)
```
