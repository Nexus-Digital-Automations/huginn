## Rails Integration Patterns (2024-2025)

### Modern Rails Architecture Integration

**Middleware-Based Metrics Collection**:
```ruby
# Recommended pattern for automatic metrics
use Prometheus::Middleware::Collector
use Prometheus::Middleware::Exporter
```

**ActiveSupport Notifications Integration**:
```ruby
# Subscribe to Rails telemetry
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('process_action.action_controller') do |name, started, finished, unique_id, data|
  # Process performance metrics
end
```

**Stimulus-Based Dashboard Controllers**:
```ruby
// app/javascript/controllers/dashboard_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"
import { Chart } from "chart.js"

export default class extends Controller {
  connect() {
    this.initializeChart()
    this.startRealTimeUpdates()
  }
}
```

## Performance Impact Assessment

### Low Impact Solutions
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Minimal application overhead, efficient metric collection
- **Basic Chartkick integration**: Simple chart rendering with minimal JavaScript

### Medium Impact Solutions  
- **Elasticsearch APM**: Agent overhead balanced by comprehensive data collection
- **ActionCable with optimized data transfer**: Manageable with proper implementation

### High Impact Solutions
- **Complex D3.js visualizations**: Significant client-side processing requirements
- **Unoptimized ActionCable implementations**: Connection and callback overhead

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Patterns
- **Prometheus**: Excellent scaling with federation and remote storage
