All tests must be production-ready with comprehensive scenarios.\n\n## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n- Mark this review task as completed ONLY if the criterion is fully met\n- If criterion fails, you MUST create remediation tasks using TaskManager API before marking review as completed\n- All new tasks should be actionable, specific, and include proper dependencies/important_files parameters\n\n## TASK CREATION REQUIREMENT\nWhen creating remediation tasks, ensure each task includes:\n- Clear success criteria\n- Appropriate category (linter-error, build-error, missing-feature, bug, enhancement, etc.)\n- Specific file dependencies\n- Realistic time estimates\n- High priority for critical issues\n- Production-ready implementation requirements\n\nUse the task-creation.md guidelines for optimal task structure.",
