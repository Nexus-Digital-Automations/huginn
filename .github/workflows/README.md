# CI/CD Quality Gates Integration System

This directory contains a comprehensive CI/CD integration system with automated quality metrics enforcement, deployment gating, and rollback capabilities for the Huginn Rails application.

## 📋 Overview

The system implements a complete quality gates workflow that enforces quality standards across the entire development lifecycle:

- **Pre-implementation validation** (context assessment, impact analysis)
- **During-implementation validation** (interface-first development, error boundaries)
- **Pre-completion validation** (completeness, integration testing)
- **Performance validation** (<200ms response times)
- **Security validation** (vulnerability scanning)
- **Deployment automation** with rollback capabilities

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ci_cd_integration.yml` | **Master orchestrator** - Coordinates all quality gates and deployment | Push, PR, Manual |
| `quality_gates.yml` | Core quality validation (linting, testing, coverage) | Called by main workflow |
| `performance_validation.yml` | Performance testing and monitoring | Called by main workflow |
| `security_validation.yml` | Security scanning and compliance | Called by main workflow |
| `deployment_automation.yml` | Deployment orchestration with rollback | Called by main workflow |
| `quality_dashboard.yml` | Quality metrics visualization | Daily schedule, Manual |
| `notification_system.yml` | Multi-channel notifications | Called on quality events |

### Reusable Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `.github/actions/quality-validation/` | Composite Action | Reusable quality validation logic |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Setup

Ensure your repository has the following secrets configured:

```bash
# Optional notification secrets
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=team@example.com,admin@example.com
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your/webhook
```

### 2. Repository Setup

The workflows are automatically active once merged to your main branch. Default behavior:

- **Push to `main`/`master`**: Full quality gates → Production deployment
- **Push to `develop`**: Full quality gates → Staging deployment  
- **Pull Requests**: Quality validation only (no deployment)
- **Manual Dispatch**: Custom environment targeting

### 3. Quality Gate Configuration

Default thresholds (configurable in workflow files):

```yaml
# Quality thresholds
QUALITY_GATE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 85      # Minimum code coverage %
QUALITY_GATE_RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD: 200   # Max response time (ms)
QUALITY_GATE_ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD: 0.1      # Max error rate %
SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD: 0         # Zero tolerance for critical vulns
```

## 📝 Customization Guide

### Adding Custom Quality Gates

1. **Create Custom Validation Step**:

```yaml
- name: Custom Quality Check
  run: |
    # Your custom validation logic
    if ! custom_quality_check; then
      echo "❌ Custom quality gate failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```

2. **Integrate with Score Calculation**:

```yaml
CUSTOM_SCORE=$(calculate_custom_score)
QUALITY_SCORE=$(( (LINTING_SCORE * 15 + TEST_SCORE * 25 + COVERAGE * 20 + CUSTOM_SCORE * 20 + PERFORMANCE_SCORE * 10 + SECURITY_SCORE * 10) / 100 ))
```

### Environment-Specific Customization

Create environment-specific workflow files:

```bash
.github/workflows/
├── quality_gates_staging.yml
├── quality_gates_production.yml
└── security_validation_production.yml
```

### Custom Notification Channels

Add your preferred notification service:

```yaml
- name: Custom Notification
  run: |
    curl -X POST "your-webhook-url" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"message": "${{ needs.quality-gates.outputs.status }}"}'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Quality Gates Always Failing**
```bash
# Check individual validation steps
gh run list --workflow=ci_cd_integration.yml
gh run view [run-id] --log
```

**Performance Tests Timing Out**
```bash
# Adjust timeout in performance_validation.yml
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT: 600  # Increase from 300 seconds
```

**Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Verify database setup in quality-validation action
sudo systemctl status postgresql
bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test
```

**Notification Delivery Failures**
```bash
# Verify webhook URLs are correctly configured
echo $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL | head -c 50  # Should show webhook start
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting in workflow:

```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```
