## Automated Reporting Framework Architecture

### 1. Report Generation Engine

**Rails Integration Pattern:**
```ruby
class PerformanceReportGenerator
  include ActionView::Helpers
  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  
  def initialize(report_type: :comprehensive, time_range: 24.hours)
    @report_type = report_type
    @time_range = time_range
    @performance_controller = PerformanceMonitoringController.new
  end
  
  # Generate report using existing monitoring data
  def generate_report
    case @report_type
    when :executive_summary
      generate_executive_report
    when :technical_detailed  
      generate_technical_report
    when :alert_digest
      generate_alert_digest
    when :trend_analysis
      generate_trend_report
    end
  end
  
  # Multi-format export capabilities
  def export_formats
    [:json, :html, :pdf, :csv]
  end
end
```

**Report Templates:**
- Executive Summary: KPI overview, trend direction, critical issues
- Technical Deep-dive: Detailed metrics, query analysis, optimization opportunities
- Alert Digest: Recent alerts, resolution status, impact analysis
- Trend Analysis: Historical comparisons, regression detection, forecasting

### 2. Flexible Scheduling Framework

**Agent-Based Scheduling Integration:**
```ruby
class PerformanceReportAgent < Agent
  default_schedule "daily" # 6am daily
  
  def default_options
    {
      'report_types' => ['executive_summary', 'technical_detailed'],
      'recipients' => [],
      'delivery_channels' => ['email', 'slack'],
      'time_range_hours' => 24,
      'include_trends' => true,
      'alert_threshold_breach_only' => false
    }
  end
  
  def check
    generate_and_distribute_reports
  end
end
```

**Multiple Scheduling Patterns:**
- **Daily Executive Reports**: Morning summary for leadership
- **Weekly Deep-dive Reports**: Comprehensive technical analysis  
- **Real-time Alert Digests**: Immediate notification of critical issues
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Long-term performance analysis
- **Event-triggered Reports**: Threshold breach or incident-based reporting

### 3. Stakeholder Personalization System

**Role-Based Report Customization:**
```ruby
class StakeholderPersonalization
  ROLES = {
    executive: {
      focus: [:kpis, :trends, :business_impact],
      format: :summary,
      metrics: [:response_time_avg, :error_rate, :uptime_percentage],
      detail_level: :high_level
    },
    technical: {
      focus: [:detailed_metrics, :optimization_opportunities, :system_health],
      format: :detailed,
      metrics: [:all_metrics, :query_performance, :resource_utilization],
      detail_level: :comprehensive
    },
    operations: {
      focus: [:alerts, :system_status, :capacity_planning],
      format: :operational,
      metrics: [:critical_alerts, :resource_thresholds, :queue_depth],
      detail_level: :actionable
    }
  }
  
  def customize_report(base_report, recipient_role)
    role_config = ROLES[recipient_role.to_sym]
    filter_content(base_report, role_config)
  end
end
```

**Personalization Features:**
- Role-based metric filtering and prioritization
- Custom threshold settings per recipient
- Preferred communication channels per stakeholder
- Historical context periods based on role requirements
- Alert severity filtering and escalation paths

### 4. Multi-Channel Distribution System

**Email Reports Enhanced:**
```ruby
class PerformanceReportMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def executive_summary_report(recipient, report_data)
    @report_data = report_data
    @recipient = recipient
    
    # Attach PDF version for offline viewing
    attachments["performance_report_#{Date.current}.pdf"] = generate_pdf_report
    
    mail(
      to: recipient.email,
      subject: "Daily Performance Summary - #{Date.current}",
      template_name: 'executive_summary'
    )
  end
  
  def technical_deep_dive(recipient, report_data)
    @report_data = report_data
    @charts_embedded = true
    
    # Include CSV export for data analysis
    attachments["performance_metrics_#{Date.current}.csv"] = generate_csv_export
    
    mail(to: recipient.email, subject: "Technical Performance Analysis")
  end
end
```

**Slack Integration Enhancement:**
```ruby
class PerformanceSlackNotifier
  def initialize
    @slack_client = Slack::Notifier.new(webhook_url)
  end
  
  def send_executive_summary(report_data)
    @slack_client.post(
      channel: '#executive-updates',
      username: 'Performance Monitor',
      icon_emoji: ':chart_with_upwards_trend:',
      attachments: build_executive_slack_attachment(report_data)
    )
  end
  
  def send_alert_digest(alerts)
    alerts.group_by(&:severity).each do |severity, severity_alerts|
      send_severity_specific_alert(severity, severity_alerts)
    end
  end
end
```

**Webhook Integration:**
```ruby
class PerformanceWebhookDelivery
  def deliver_report(webhook_url, report_data, format: :json)
    case format
    when :json
      HTTParty.post(webhook_url, 
        body: report_data.to_json,
        headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' }
      )
    when :webhook_formatted
      HTTParty.post(webhook_url,
        body: format_for_webhook(report_data)
      )
    end
  end
end
```

### 5. Report Intelligence Features  

**Automated Insights Engine:**
```ruby
class PerformanceInsightsGenerator
  def generate_insights(metrics_data)
    insights = []
    
    # Trend analysis
    if response_time_trending_up?(metrics_data)
      insights << {
        type: :warning,
        category: :performance_degradation,
        message: "Response times increased 15% over past week",
        recommendation: "Review recent deployments and database query patterns",
        impact: :medium,
        urgency: :high
      }
    end
    
    # Anomaly detection
    anomalies = detect_performance_anomalies(metrics_data)
    insights.concat(format_anomaly_insights(anomalies))
    
    # Resource optimization opportunities
    if memory_usage_pattern_suggests_leak?(metrics_data)
      insights << memory_leak_recommendation
    end
    
    insights
  end
  
  # Automated comparison with historical baselines
  def comparative_analysis(current_metrics, historical_baseline)
    {
      performance_change: calculate_performance_delta(current_metrics, historical_baseline),
      regression_alerts: identify_regressions(current_metrics, historical_baseline),
      improvement_opportunities: suggest_optimizations(current_metrics)
    }
  end
end
```

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Statistical analysis of performance patterns using existing regression detection
- Machine learning-based outlier identification
- Correlation analysis between system metrics and business events
- Predictive alerting based on trending patterns
