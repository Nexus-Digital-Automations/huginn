They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Below them are instructions to get you started.\n\n![Example list of agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/your-agents.png)\n\n![Event flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/diagram.png)\n\n![Detecting peaks in Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/peaks.png)\n\n![Logging your location over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/my-locations.png)\n\n![Making a new agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Docker\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Below them are instructions to get you started.\n\n![Example list of agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/your-agents.png)\n\n![Event flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/diagram.png)\n\n![Detecting peaks in Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/peaks.png)\n\n![Logging your location over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/my-locations.png)\n\n![Making a new agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/new-agent.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n📖 **For comprehensive documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**\n\n### Docker\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the official Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf.  Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph.  Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server.  You always know who has your data.  You do.\n\n![the origin of the name](docs/images/the-name.png)\n\n#### Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:\n\n* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow (\"Don't forget your umbrella!\")\n* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.  (For example, want to know when something interesting has happened in the world of Machine Learning?  Huginn will watch the term \"machine learning\" on Twitter and tell you when there is a spike in discussion.)\n* Watch for air travel or shopping deals\n* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them\n* Scrape websites and receive email when they change\n* Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo, to name a few.\n* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day\n* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike, such as the term \"san francisco emergency\"\n* Send and receive WebHooks\n* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions\n* Track your location over time\n* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents (the Amazon Turk Agent is called the \"HumanTaskAgent\"). For example: \"Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.\"\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Changelog #199](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23199-lightgrey.svg)](https://changelog.com/podcast/199)\n\nJoin us in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/huginn/huginn) to discuss the project.\n\n### Join us!\n\nWant to help with Huginn?

Have a look at the [documentation](docs/installation/docker/install.md).\n\n### Local Installation\n\nIf you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:\n\n* Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork.\n* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable.\n* Make sure that you have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. (On a Mac, the easiest way is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you're going to use PostgreSQL, you'll need to prepend all commands below with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql`.)\n* Run `bundle` to install dependencies\n* Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development database with some example Agents.\n* Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`.\n* Setup some Agents!\n* Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents.\n* Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.\n\nNote: By default, email messages are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view\nthem at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real email via SMTP when playing\nwith Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n\n[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/\n[wiki]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki\n[novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide\n\n### Develop\n\nAll agents have specs! And there's also acceptance tests that simulate running Huginn in a headless browser.\n\n* Install PhantomJS 2.1.1 or greater:\n  * Using [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install phantomjs`\n  * Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX `brew install phantomjs`\n* Run all specs with `bundle exec rspec`\n* Run a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/test_spec.rb`.\n* Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).\n\n## Using Huginn Agent gems\n\nHuginn Agents can now be written as external gems and be added to your Huginn installation with the `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` environment variable. See the `Additional Agent gems` section of `.env.example` for more information.\n\nIf you'd like to write your own Huginn Agent Gem, please see [huginn_agent](https://github.com/huginn/huginn_agent).\n\nOur general intention is to encourage complex and specific Agents to be written as Gems, while continuing to add new general-purpose Agents to the core Huginn repository.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers.\n\n### Heroku\n\nTry Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](docs/installation/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!) Huginn launches only on a paid subscription plan for Heroku. For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's 1GB paid plan or our Docker container.\n\n### OpenShift\n\n#### OpenShift Online\n\nTry Huginn on OpenShift Online\n\nCreate a new app with either `mysql` or `postgres`:\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-mysql.json\n```\nor\n```bash\noc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/openshift/templates/huginn-postgresql.json\n```\n**Note**: You can also use the web console to import either json file by going to \"Add to Project\" -> \"Import YAML/JSON\".\n\nIf you are on the Starter plan, make sure to follow the [guide](https://docs.openshift.com/online/getting_started/beyond_the_basics.html#btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code) to remove any existing application.\n\nThe templates should work on a v3 installation or the current v4 online.\n\n### Manual installation on any server\n\nHave a look at the [installation guide](docs/installation/manual/README.md).\n\n### Optional Setup\n\n#### Setup for private development\n\nSee [private development instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki.\n\n#### Enable the WeatherAgent\n\nIn order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [Weather Data API key from Pirate Weather](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data). Sign up for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent.\n\n#### Disable SSL\n\nWe assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`.\n\n## License\n\nHuginn is provided under the MIT License.\n\nHuginn was originally created by [@cantino](https://github.com/cantino) in 2013.

    "originalFile": "## Deploy to Heroku\n\nHuginn works very well on the cheapest Heroku paid plan. This is what we recommend if you want to use Huginn on Heroku.\n\nNotes for any Heroku plan:\n\n* The `setup_heroku` command points Heroku at a special Procfile (`deployment/heroku/Procfile.heroku`) that is designed to be run on only one Heroku web worker.  If you want to run multiple workers, change the Heroku config variable `PROCFILE_PATH` with `heroku config:set PROCFILE_PATH=./Procfile` and switch back to the standard Huginn Procfile configuration.\n\nIf you still wish to use the Heroku free plan (which won't work very well), please understand the following:\n\n* Heroku's [free plan](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) limits total runtime per day to 18 hours. This means that Huginn must sleep some of the time, and so recurring tasks will only run if their recurrence frequency fits within the free plan's awake time, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, we recommend that you only use the every 1 minute, every 2 minute, and every 5 minute Agent scheduling options.\n* If you're using the free plan, you need to signup for a free [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com) account and have it ping your Huginn URL on Heroku once every 70 minutes.  If you still receive warnings from Heroku, try a longer interval. \n* Another way if you're using the free plan, you can create a Http Status Agent on your Heroku Huginn instance itself and ping your own domain at huginn-example.herokuapp.com every 10 minutes.\n* Heroku's free Postgres plan limits the number of database rows that you can have to 10,000, so you should be sure to set a low event retention schedule for your agents and set `AGENT_LOG_LENGTH`, the number of log lines kept in the DB per Agent, to something small: `heroku config:set AGENT_LOG_LENGTH=20`.\n* 512MB of RAM may not be enough for Huginn and it may stop working as RAM usage increases over time.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and then run `heroku login`\n* Go into your huginn directory and run `cp .env.example .env && bundle`\n* Now, run the magic setup wizard: `bin/setup_heroku`\n* That's it!\n* If you make changes, you can re-run `bin/setup_heroku`, or just do `git push heroku master`.\n* Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/update.md) when you want to update your Huginn installation.\n\n### Using your own mail server\n\n```bash\n# Outgoing email settings.  To use Gmail or Google Apps, put your Google Apps domain or gmail.com\n# as the SMTP_DOMAIN and your Gmail username and password as the SMTP_USER_NAME and SMTP_PASSWORD.\nheroku config:set SMTP_DOMAIN=your-domain-here.com\nheroku config:set SMTP_USER_NAME=you@gmail.com\nheroku config:set SMTP_PASSWORD=somepassword\nheroku config:set SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com\n\n# The address from which system emails will appear to be sent.\nheroku config:set EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=you@gmail.com\n```\n\n### Backing up your data\n\nSee: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export\n\n### Example output from `bin/setup_heroku`\n\n```\n~/projects/oss/huginn (master)$ bin/setup_heroku \n\nWelcome andrew@example.com!

    "originalFile": "# Installation from source\n\n\n## Important Notes\n\nThis guide is long because it covers many cases and includes all commands you need.\n\nThis installation guide was created for and tested on **Debian/Ubuntu** operating systems. Please read [doc/install/requirements.md](./requirements.md) for hardware and operating system requirements.\n\nThis is the official installation guide to set up a production server. To set up a **development installation** or for many other installation options please see [the getting started section of the readme](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started).\n\nThe following steps have been known to work. Please **use caution when you deviate** from this guide. Make sure you don't violate any assumptions Huginn makes about its environment. For example many people run into permission problems because they change the location of directories or run services as the wrong user.\n\nIf you find a bug/error in this guide please **submit a pull request**.\n\nIf not stated otherwise all commands should be run as user with sudo permissions or as root.\n\nWhen having problems during the installation please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Huginn installation consists of setting up the following components:\n\n1. Packages / Dependencies\n1. Ruby\n1. System Users\n1. Database\n1. Huginn\n1. Nginx\n\n## 1. Packages / Dependencies\n\n`sudo` is not installed on Debian by default. Make sure your system is\nup-to-date and install it.\n\n    # run as root!\n    apt-get update -y\n    apt-get upgrade -y\n    apt-get install sudo -y\n\n**Note:** During this installation some files will need to be edited manually. If you are familiar with vim set it as default editor with the commands below. If you are not familiar with vim please skip this and keep using the default editor.\n\n    # Install vim and set as default editor\n    sudo apt-get install -y vim\n    sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\nInstall the required packages (needed to compile Ruby and native extensions to Ruby gems):\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit build-essential git zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server checkinstall libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev logrotate pkg-config cmake nodejs graphviz jq shared-mime-info\n\n\n### Debian Stretch\n\nSince Debian Stretch, `runit` isn't started anymore automatically, but this gets handled by the init system. Additionally, Ruby requires the OpenSSL 1.0 development packages instead of 1.1. For a default installation use these packages:\n\n     sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd libssl1.0-dev\n\n### Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic\n\nTo start `runit` automatically on Ubuntu Bionic, we need to install `runit-systemd`:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd\n\n## 2. Ruby\n\nThe use of Ruby version managers such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/), [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with Huginn in production frequently leads to hard-to-diagnose problems. Version managers are not supported and we strongly advise everyone to follow the instructions below to use a system Ruby.\n\nRemove the old Ruby versions if present:\n\n    sudo apt-get remove -y ruby1.8 ruby1.9\n\nDownload Ruby and compile it:\n\n    mkdir /tmp/ruby && cd /tmp/ruby\n    curl -L --progress-bar https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/3.2/ruby-3.2.6.tar.xz | tar xJ\n    cd ruby-3.2.6\n    ./configure --disable-install-rdoc\n    make -j`nproc`\n    sudo make install\n\nInstall foreman:\n\n    sudo gem install foreman --no-document\n\n## 3. System Users\n\nCreate a user for Huginn:\n\n    sudo adduser --disabled-login --gecos 'Huginn' huginn\n\n## 4. Database\n\n### MySQL / MariaDB\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\n\nFor Debian Stretch, replace `libmysqlclient-dev` with `default-libmysqlclient-dev`. See the [additional notes section](#additional-notes) for more information.\n\nFor Debian BullsEye:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev\n\nCheck the installed MySQL version (remember if its >= 5.5.3 for the `.env` configuration done later):\n\n    mysql --version\n\nSecure your installation. During this step, you will be prompted to pick a MySQL root password (can be anything)\n\n    sudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nThe `mysql_secure_installation` script does not apply the user-provided password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems. To apply a password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems, see the [additional notes section](#set-password-for-root-MySQL-user-on-Ubuntu) for more information before proceeding.\n\nLogin to MySQL using the root password you set in the previous steps\n\n    mysql -u root -p\n\n    # Type the MySQL root password\n\nCreate a user for Huginn do not type the `mysql>`, this is part of the prompt. Change `$password` in the command below to a real password you pick\n\n    mysql> CREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\n\nEnsure you can use the InnoDB engine which is necessary to support long indexes\n\n    mysql> SET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n    # If this fails, check your MySQL config files (e.g. `/etc/mysql/*.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/*`)\n    # for the setting \"innodb = off\"\n\nGrant the Huginn user necessary permissions on the database\n\n    mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\nUse the flush privileges command to save the new permissions\n\n    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nQuit the database session\n\n    mysql> \\q\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H mysql -u huginn -p -D huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you replaced $password with earlier\n\nYou should now see `ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'huginn_production'` which is fine because we will create the database later.\n\nYou are done installing the database and can go back to the rest of the installation.\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql libpq-dev\n\nCreate a user for Huginn and set its database connection password. If you want the user to be able to create the database, add `-d`\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createuser -P huginn\n\nCreate a database\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createdb -O huginn -T template0 huginn_production\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn psql -h localhost -W huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you set earlier\n\nYou should now be greeted by the `psql` interactive client and be connected to the `huginn_production` database. Quit the database session with `\\q` or `CTRL-D`\n\n## 5. Huginn\n\n### Clone the Source\n\n    # We'll install Huginn into the home directory of the user \"huginn\"\n    cd /home/huginn\n\n    # Clone Huginn repository\n    sudo -u huginn -H git clone https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git -b master huginn\n\n    # Go to Huginn installation folder\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n\n    # Copy the example Huginn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp .env.example .env\n\n    # Create the log/, tmp/pids/ and tmp/sockets/ directories\n    sudo -u huginn mkdir -p log tmp/pids tmp/sockets\n\n    # Make sure Huginn can write to the log/ and tmp/ directories\n    sudo chown -R huginn log/ tmp/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/ tmp/\n\n    # Make sure permissions are set correctly\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/\n    sudo -u huginn -H chmod o-rwx .env\n\n    # Copy the example Unicorn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp config/unicorn.rb.example config/unicorn.rb\n\n### Configure it\n\n    # Update Huginn config file and follow the instructions\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor .env\n\nIf you are using a local MySQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn MySQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    #DATABASE_HOST=your-domain-here.com\n    #DATABASE_PORT=3306\n    #DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n    # MySQL only: If you are running a MySQL server >=5.5.3, you should\n    # set DATABASE_ENCODING to utf8mb4 instead of utf8 so that the\n    # database can hold 4-byte UTF-8 characters like emoji.\n    #DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4\n\nIf you are using a local PostgreSQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn PostgreSQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    DATABASE_HOST=localhost\n    DATABASE_PORT=5432\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n\n**Important**: Uncomment the RAILS_ENV setting to run Huginn in the production rails environment\n\n    RAILS_ENV=production\n\nChange the Unicorn config if needed, the [requirements.md](./requirements.md#unicorn-workers) has a section explaining the suggested amount of unicorn workers:\n\n    # Increase the amount of workers if you expect to have a high load instance.\n    # 2 are enough for most use cases, if the server has less then 2GB of RAM\n    # decrease the worker amount to 1\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor config/unicorn.rb\n\n\n**Important Note:** Make sure to edit both `.env` and `unicorn.rb` to match your setup.\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\n**Note:** For configuration changes after finishing the initial installation you have to re-export (see [Install Init Script](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/installation.md#install-init-script)) the init script every time you change `.env`, `unicorn.rb` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Install Gems\n\n**Note:** As of bundler 1.5.2, you can invoke `bundle install -jN` (where `N` the number of your processor cores) and enjoy parallel gem installation with measurable difference in completion time (~60% faster). Check the number of your cores with `nproc`. For more information check this [post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler). First make sure you have bundler >= 1.5.2 (run `bundle -v`) as it addresses some [issues](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/411) that were [fixed](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/2817) in 1.5.2.\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle install --deployment --without development test\n\n### Initialize Database\n\n    # Create the database\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Migrate to the latest version\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Create admin user and example agents using the default admin/password login\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n\nWhen done you see `See the Huginn Wiki for more Agent examples!  https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki`\n\n**Note:** This will create an initial user, you can change the username and password by supplying it in environmental variables `SEED_USERNAME` and `SEED_PASSWORD` as seen above. If you don't change the password (and it is set to the default one) please wait with exposing Huginn to the public internet until the installation is done and you've logged into the server and changed your password.\n\n### Compile Assets\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production\n\n### Install Init Script\n\nHuginn uses [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to generate the init scripts based on a `Procfile`\n\nEdit the [`Procfile`](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile) and choose one of the suggested versions for production\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor Procfile\n\nComment out (disable) [these two lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L6-L7)\n\n    web: bundle exec rails server -p ${PORT-3000} -b ${IP-0.0.0.0}\n    jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\nEnable (remove the comment) [from these lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L24-L25) or [those](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L28-L31)\n\n    # web: bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb\n    # jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\n**Note:** Ensure you have no leading spaces before `web:` or `jobs:` in your `Procfile` file.\n\nIf you use a directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/` for the app, change the location of the `runit` logfile in `lib/tasks/production.rake`, for example:\n    run('foreman export runit -a huginn -l /opt/huginn/log /etc/service')\n\nExport the init scripts:\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:export\n\n**Note:** You have to re-export the init script every time you change the configuration in `.env` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Setup Logrotate\n\n    sudo cp deployment/logrotate/huginn /etc/logrotate.d/huginn\n\nChange the location of the log directory if you have chosen to log to a different directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/log/`\n\n### Ensure Your Huginn Instance Is Running\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:status\n\n## 6. Nginx\n\n**Note:** Nginx is the officially supported web server for Huginn. If you cannot or do not want to use Nginx as your web server, the wiki has a page on how to configure [apache](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Apache-Huginn-configuration).\n\n### Installation\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n### Site Configuration\n\nCopy the example site config:\n\n    sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/huginn\n\nMake sure to edit the config file to match your setup, if you are running multiple nginx sites remove the `default_server` argument from the `listen` directives:\n\n    # Change YOUR_SERVER_FQDN to the fully-qualified\n    # domain name of your host serving Huginn.\n    sudo editor /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n\nRemove the default nginx site, **if huginn is the only enabled nginx site**:\n\n    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, replace the `huginn` Nginx config with `huginn-ssl`. See [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for HTTPS configuration details.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nValidate your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file with the following command:\n\n    sudo nginx -t\n\nYou should receive `syntax is okay` and `test is successful` messages. If you receive errors check your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file for typos, etc. as indicated in the error message given.\n\n### Restart\n\n    sudo service nginx restart\n\n# Done!\n\n### Initial Login\n\nVisit YOUR_SERVER in your web browser for your first Huginn login. The setup has created a default admin account for you. You can use it to log in:\n\n    admin (or your SEED_USERNAME)\n    password (or your SEED_PASSWORD)\n\n\n**Enjoy!** :sparkles: :star: :fireworks:\n\nYou can use `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:start` and `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:stop` to start and stop Huginn.\n\nBe sure to read the section about how to [update](./update.md) your Huginn installation as well! You can also use [Capistrano](./capistrano.md) to keep your installation up to date.\n\n**Note:** We also recommend applying standard security practices to your server, including installing a firewall ([ufw](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) is good on Ubuntu and also available for Debian).\n\n## Advanced Setup Tips\n\n### Using HTTPS\n\nTo use Huginn with HTTPS:\n\n1. In `.env`:\n    1. Set the `FORCE_SSL` option to `true`.\n1. Use the `huginn-ssl` Nginx example config instead of the `huginn` config:\n    1. `sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn-ssl /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn`\n    1. Update `YOUR_SERVER_FQDN`.\n    1. Update `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`.\n    1. Review the configuration file and consider applying other security and performance enhancing features.\n\nRestart Nginx, export the init script and restart Huginn:\n\n```\ncd /home/huginn/huginn\nsudo service nginx restart\nsudo bundle exec rake production:export\n```\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate is discouraged, but if you must use it follow the normal directions. Then generate the certificate:\n\n```\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/\ncd /etc/nginx/ssl/\nsudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -days 3560 -out huginn.crt -keyout huginn.key\nsudo chmod o-r huginn.key\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something went wrong during the installation please make sure you followed the instructions and did not miss a step.\n\nWhen your Huginn instance still is not working first run the self check:\n\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:check\n\nWe are sorry when you are still having issues, now please check the various log files for error messages:\n\n#### Nginx error log `/var/log/nginx/huginn_error.log`\n\nThis file should be empty, it is the first place to look because `nginx` is the first application handling the request your are sending to Huginn.\n\nCommon problems:\n\n* `connect() to unix:/home/huginn/huginn/tmp/sockets/unicorn.socket failed`: The Unicorn application server is not running, ensure you uncommented one of the example configuration below the `PRODUCTION` label in your [Procfile](#install-init-script) and the unicorn config file (`/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb`) exists.\n* `138 open() \"/home/huginn/huginn/public/...\" failed (13: Permission denied)`: The `/home/huginn/huginn/public` directory needs to be readable by the nginx user (which is per default `www-data`)\n\n\n#### Unicorn log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/unicorn.log`\n\nShould only contain HTTP request log entries like: `10.0.2.2 - - [18/Aug/2015:21:15:12 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 - 0.0110`\n\nIf you see ruby exception backtraces or other error messages the problem could be one of the following:\n\n* The configuration file `/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb` does not exist\n* Gem dependencies where not [installed](#install-gems)\n\n#### Rails Application log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/production.log`\n\nThis file is pretty verbose, you want to look at it if you are getting the `We're sorry, but something went wrong.` error message when using Huginn. This is an example backtrace that can help you or other huginn developers locate the issue:\n\n```\nNoMethodError (undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass):\n  app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb:6:in `index'\n  config/initializers/silence_worker_status_logger.rb:5:in `call_with_silence_worker_status'\n```\n\n#### Runit/Background Worker logs `/home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current`\n\nThose files will contain error messages or backtraces if one of your agent is not performing as they should. The easiest way to debug an Agent is to watch all your log files for changes and trigger the agent to run via the Huginn web interface.\n\nThe log file location depends your `Procfile` configuration, this command will give you a list of the available logs:\n\n    ls -al /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\nWhen you want to monitor the background processes you can easily watch all the files for changes:\n\n    tail -f /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\n### Still having problems? :crying_cat_face:\n\nYou probably found an error message or exception backtrace you could not resolve. Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues) and include as much information as you could gather about the problem your are experiencing.\n\n\n### Additional notes\n\nDebian Stretch switched from MySQL to [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). All packages with `mysql` in the name are just wrappers around the MariaDB ones, with some containing some compatibility symlinks. Huginn should also work fine with the MariaDB packages directly, although to keep the installation instructions more compact, they still use the MySQL packages.\n\n#### Set password for root MySQL user on Ubuntu\n\nMySQL installations (>= 5.7.26) on Ubuntu use the UNIX `auth_socket` plugin by default, such that authentication is handled by system user credientials. In order to access the MySQL root user from any system user, you have to set the MySQL root user password in the user database. Sign into the MySQL shell \n\n    sudo mysql -u root -p\n\n    # The default password upon installation is blank\n\nOnce in the MySQL shell, run the following command to set the password for the root user by replacing `new-password` with a password of your choice\n\n    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';\n\nAfter the change has been made, exit the MySQL shell with `\\q`. \n\nFor the change to propogate, restart the MySQL server\n\n    sudo service mysql restart\n",

Please read [requirements.md](./requirements.md) for hardware and operating system requirements.\n\nThis is the official installation guide to set up a production server. To set up a **development installation** or for many other installation options please see [the getting started section of the readme](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started).\n\nThe following steps have been known to work. Please **use caution when you deviate** from this guide. Make sure you don't violate any assumptions Huginn makes about its environment. For example many people run into permission problems because they change the location of directories or run services as the wrong user.\n\nIf you find a bug/error in this guide please **submit a pull request**.\n\nIf not stated otherwise all commands should be run as user with sudo permissions or as root.\n\nWhen having problems during the installation please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Huginn installation consists of setting up the following components:\n\n1. Packages / Dependencies\n1. Ruby\n1. System Users\n1. Database\n1. Huginn\n1. Nginx\n\n## 1. Packages / Dependencies\n\n`sudo` is not installed on Debian by default. Make sure your system is\nup-to-date and install it.\n\n    # run as root!\n    apt-get update -y\n    apt-get upgrade -y\n    apt-get install sudo -y\n\n**Note:** During this installation some files will need to be edited manually. If you are familiar with vim set it as default editor with the commands below. If you are not familiar with vim please skip this and keep using the default editor.\n\n    # Install vim and set as default editor\n    sudo apt-get install -y vim\n    sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.basic\n\nInstall the required packages (needed to compile Ruby and native extensions to Ruby gems):\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit build-essential git zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server checkinstall libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev logrotate pkg-config cmake nodejs graphviz jq shared-mime-info\n\n\n### Debian Stretch\n\nSince Debian Stretch, `runit` isn't started anymore automatically, but this gets handled by the init system. Additionally, Ruby requires the OpenSSL 1.0 development packages instead of 1.1. For a default installation use these packages:\n\n     sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd libssl1.0-dev\n\n### Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic\n\nTo start `runit` automatically on Ubuntu Bionic, we need to install `runit-systemd`:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y runit-systemd\n\n## 2. Ruby\n\nThe use of Ruby version managers such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/), [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with Huginn in production frequently leads to hard-to-diagnose problems. Version managers are not supported and we strongly advise everyone to follow the instructions below to use a system Ruby.\n\nRemove the old Ruby versions if present:\n\n    sudo apt-get remove -y ruby1.8 ruby1.9\n\nDownload Ruby and compile it:\n\n    mkdir /tmp/ruby && cd /tmp/ruby\n    curl -L --progress-bar https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/3.2/ruby-3.2.6.tar.xz | tar xJ\n    cd ruby-3.2.6\n    ./configure --disable-install-rdoc\n    make -j`nproc`\n    sudo make install\n\nInstall foreman:\n\n    sudo gem install foreman --no-document\n\n## 3. System Users\n\nCreate a user for Huginn:\n\n    sudo adduser --disabled-login --gecos 'Huginn' huginn\n\n## 4. Database\n\n### MySQL / MariaDB\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\n\nFor Debian Stretch, replace `libmysqlclient-dev` with `default-libmysqlclient-dev`. See the [additional notes section](#additional-notes) for more information.\n\nFor Debian BullsEye:\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev\n\nCheck the installed MySQL version (remember if its >= 5.5.3 for the `.env` configuration done later):\n\n    mysql --version\n\nSecure your installation. During this step, you will be prompted to pick a MySQL root password (can be anything)\n\n    sudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nThe `mysql_secure_installation` script does not apply the user-provided password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems. To apply a password to the MySQL root user on Ubuntu systems, see the [additional notes section](#set-password-for-root-MySQL-user-on-Ubuntu) for more information before proceeding.\n\nLogin to MySQL using the root password you set in the previous steps\n\n    mysql -u root -p\n\n    # Type the MySQL root password\n\nCreate a user for Huginn do not type the `mysql>`, this is part of the prompt. Change `$password` in the command below to a real password you pick\n\n    mysql> CREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';\n\nEnsure you can use the InnoDB engine which is necessary to support long indexes\n\n    mysql> SET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n    # If this fails, check your MySQL config files (e.g. `/etc/mysql/*.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/*`)\n    # for the setting \"innodb = off\"\n\nGrant the Huginn user necessary permissions on the database\n\n    mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\nUse the flush privileges command to save the new permissions\n\n    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nQuit the database session\n\n    mysql> \\q\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H mysql -u huginn -p -D huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you replaced $password with earlier\n\nYou should now see `ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'huginn_production'` which is fine because we will create the database later.\n\nYou are done installing the database and can go back to the rest of the installation.\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\nInstall the database packages\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql libpq-dev\n\nCreate a user for Huginn and set its database connection password. If you want the user to be able to create the database, add `-d`\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createuser -P huginn\n\nCreate a database\n\n    sudo -u postgres -H createdb -O huginn -T template0 huginn_production\n\nTry connecting to the new database with the new user\n\n    sudo -u huginn psql -h localhost -W huginn_production\n\n    # Type the password you set earlier\n\nYou should now be greeted by the `psql` interactive client and be connected to the `huginn_production` database. Quit the database session with `\\q` or `CTRL-D`\n\n## 5. Huginn\n\n### Clone the Source\n\n    # We'll install Huginn into the home directory of the user \"huginn\"\n    cd /home/huginn\n\n    # Clone Huginn repository\n    sudo -u huginn -H git clone https://github.com/huginn/huginn.git -b master huginn\n\n    # Go to Huginn installation folder\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n\n    # Copy the example Huginn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp .env.example .env\n\n    # Create the log/, tmp/pids/ and tmp/sockets/ directories\n    sudo -u huginn mkdir -p log tmp/pids tmp/sockets\n\n    # Make sure Huginn can write to the log/ and tmp/ directories\n    sudo chown -R huginn log/ tmp/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/ tmp/\n\n    # Make sure permissions are set correctly\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/\n    sudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/\n    sudo -u huginn -H chmod o-rwx .env\n\n    # Copy the example Unicorn config\n    sudo -u huginn -H cp config/unicorn.rb.example config/unicorn.rb\n\n### Configure it\n\n    # Update Huginn config file and follow the instructions\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor .env\n\nIf you are using a local MySQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn MySQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    #DATABASE_HOST=your-domain-here.com\n    #DATABASE_PORT=3306\n    #DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n    # MySQL only: If you are running a MySQL server >=5.5.3, you should\n    # set DATABASE_ENCODING to utf8mb4 instead of utf8 so that the\n    # database can hold 4-byte UTF-8 characters like emoji.\n    #DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4\n\nIf you are using a local PostgreSQL server the database configuration should look like this (use the password of the huginn PostgreSQL user you created earlier):\n\n    DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n    DATABASE_RECONNECT=true\n    DATABASE_NAME=huginn_production\n    DATABASE_POOL=20\n    DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n    DATABASE_PASSWORD='$password'\n    DATABASE_HOST=localhost\n    DATABASE_PORT=5432\n\n    DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\n\n**Important**: Uncomment the RAILS_ENV setting to run Huginn in the production rails environment\n\n    RAILS_ENV=production\n\nChange the Unicorn config if needed, the [requirements.md](./requirements.md#unicorn-workers) has a section explaining the suggested amount of unicorn workers:\n\n    # Increase the amount of workers if you expect to have a high load instance.\n    # 2 are enough for most use cases, if the server has less then 2GB of RAM\n    # decrease the worker amount to 1\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor config/unicorn.rb\n\n\n**Important Note:** Make sure to edit both `.env` and `unicorn.rb` to match your setup.\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\n**Note:** For configuration changes after finishing the initial installation you have to re-export (see [Install Init Script](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/doc/manual/installation.md#install-init-script)) the init script every time you change `.env`, `unicorn.rb` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Install Gems\n\n**Note:** As of bundler 1.5.2, you can invoke `bundle install -jN` (where `N` the number of your processor cores) and enjoy parallel gem installation with measurable difference in completion time (~60% faster). Check the number of your cores with `nproc`. For more information check this [post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler). First make sure you have bundler >= 1.5.2 (run `bundle -v`) as it addresses some [issues](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/411) that were [fixed](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/2817) in 1.5.2.\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle install --deployment --without development test\n\n### Initialize Database\n\n    # Create the database\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Migrate to the latest version\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production\n\n    # Create admin user and example agents using the default admin/password login\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n\nWhen done you see `See the Huginn Wiki for more Agent examples!  https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki`\n\n**Note:** This will create an initial user, you can change the username and password by supplying it in environmental variables `SEED_USERNAME` and `SEED_PASSWORD` as seen above. If you don't change the password (and it is set to the default one) please wait with exposing Huginn to the public internet until the installation is done and you've logged into the server and changed your password.\n\n### Compile Assets\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production\n\n### Install Init Script\n\nHuginn uses [foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to generate the init scripts based on a `Procfile`\n\nEdit the [`Procfile`](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile) and choose one of the suggested versions for production\n\n    sudo -u huginn -H editor Procfile\n\nComment out (disable) [these two lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L6-L7)\n\n    web: bundle exec rails server -p ${PORT-3000} -b ${IP-0.0.0.0}\n    jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\nEnable (remove the comment) [from these lines](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L24-L25) or [those](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/Procfile#L28-L31)\n\n    # web: bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb\n    # jobs: bundle exec rails runner bin/threaded.rb\n\n**Note:** Ensure you have no leading spaces before `web:` or `jobs:` in your `Procfile` file.\n\nIf you use a directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/` for the app, change the location of the `runit` logfile in `lib/tasks/production.rake`, for example:\n    run('foreman export runit -a huginn -l /opt/huginn/log /etc/service')\n\nExport the init scripts:\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:export\n\n**Note:** You have to re-export the init script every time you change the configuration in `.env` or your `Procfile`!\n\n### Setup Logrotate\n\n    sudo cp deployment/logrotate/huginn /etc/logrotate.d/huginn\n\nChange the location of the log directory if you have chosen to log to a different directory other than `/home/huginn/huginn/log/`\n\n### Ensure Your Huginn Instance Is Running\n\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:status\n\n## 6. Nginx\n\n**Note:** Nginx is the officially supported web server for Huginn. If you cannot or do not want to use Nginx as your web server, the wiki has a page on how to configure [apache](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Apache-Huginn-configuration).\n\n### Installation\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n### Site Configuration\n\nCopy the example site config:\n\n    sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/huginn\n\nMake sure to edit the config file to match your setup, if you are running multiple nginx sites remove the `default_server` argument from the `listen` directives:\n\n    # Change YOUR_SERVER_FQDN to the fully-qualified\n    # domain name of your host serving Huginn.\n    sudo editor /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn\n\nRemove the default nginx site, **if huginn is the only enabled nginx site**:\n\n    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n**Note:** If you want to use HTTPS, which is what we recommend, replace the `huginn` Nginx config with `huginn-ssl`. See [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for HTTPS configuration details.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nValidate your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file with the following command:\n\n    sudo nginx -t\n\nYou should receive `syntax is okay` and `test is successful` messages. If you receive errors check your `huginn` or `huginn-ssl` Nginx config file for typos, etc. as indicated in the error message given.\n\n### Restart\n\n    sudo service nginx restart\n\n# Done!\n\n### Initial Login\n\nVisit YOUR_SERVER in your web browser for your first Huginn login. The setup has created a default admin account for you. You can use it to log in:\n\n    admin (or your SEED_USERNAME)\n    password (or your SEED_PASSWORD)\n\n\n**Enjoy!** :sparkles: :star: :fireworks:\n\nYou can use `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:start` and `cd /home/huginn/huginn && sudo bundle exec rake production:stop` to start and stop Huginn.\n\nBe sure to read the section about how to [update](./update.md) your Huginn installation as well! You can also use [Capistrano](./capistrano.md) to keep your installation up to date.\n\n**Note:** We also recommend applying standard security practices to your server, including installing a firewall ([ufw](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) is good on Ubuntu and also available for Debian).\n\n## Advanced Setup Tips\n\n### Using HTTPS\n\nTo use Huginn with HTTPS:\n\n1. In `.env`:\n    1. Set the `FORCE_SSL` option to `true`.\n1. Use the `huginn-ssl` Nginx example config instead of the `huginn` config:\n    1. `sudo cp deployment/nginx/huginn-ssl /etc/nginx/sites-available/huginn`\n    1. Update `YOUR_SERVER_FQDN`.\n    1. Update `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`.\n    1. Review the configuration file and consider applying other security and performance enhancing features.\n\nRestart Nginx, export the init script and restart Huginn:\n\n```\ncd /home/huginn/huginn\nsudo service nginx restart\nsudo bundle exec rake production:export\n```\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate is discouraged, but if you must use it follow the normal directions. Then generate the certificate:\n\n```\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/\ncd /etc/nginx/ssl/\nsudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -days 3560 -out huginn.crt -keyout huginn.key\nsudo chmod o-r huginn.key\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something went wrong during the installation please make sure you followed the instructions and did not miss a step.\n\nWhen your Huginn instance still is not working first run the self check:\n\n    cd /home/huginn/huginn\n    sudo bundle exec rake production:check\n\nWe are sorry when you are still having issues, now please check the various log files for error messages:\n\n#### Nginx error log `/var/log/nginx/huginn_error.log`\n\nThis file should be empty, it is the first place to look because `nginx` is the first application handling the request your are sending to Huginn.\n\nCommon problems:\n\n* `connect() to unix:/home/huginn/huginn/tmp/sockets/unicorn.socket failed`: The Unicorn application server is not running, ensure you uncommented one of the example configuration below the `PRODUCTION` label in your [Procfile](#install-init-script) and the unicorn config file (`/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb`) exists.\n* `138 open() \"/home/huginn/huginn/public/...\" failed (13: Permission denied)`: The `/home/huginn/huginn/public` directory needs to be readable by the nginx user (which is per default `www-data`)\n\n\n#### Unicorn log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/unicorn.log`\n\nShould only contain HTTP request log entries like: `10.0.2.2 - - [18/Aug/2015:21:15:12 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 - 0.0110`\n\nIf you see ruby exception backtraces or other error messages the problem could be one of the following:\n\n* The configuration file `/home/huginn/huginn/config/unicorn.rb` does not exist\n* Gem dependencies where not [installed](#install-gems)\n\n#### Rails Application log `/home/huginn/huginn/log/production.log`\n\nThis file is pretty verbose, you want to look at it if you are getting the `We're sorry, but something went wrong.` error message when using Huginn. This is an example backtrace that can help you or other huginn developers locate the issue:\n\n```\nNoMethodError (undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass):\n  app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb:6:in `index'\n  config/initializers/silence_worker_status_logger.rb:5:in `call_with_silence_worker_status'\n```\n\n#### Runit/Background Worker logs `/home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current`\n\nThose files will contain error messages or backtraces if one of your agent is not performing as they should. The easiest way to debug an Agent is to watch all your log files for changes and trigger the agent to run via the Huginn web interface.\n\nThe log file location depends your `Procfile` configuration, this command will give you a list of the available logs:\n\n    ls -al /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\nWhen you want to monitor the background processes you can easily watch all the files for changes:\n\n    tail -f /home/huginn/huginn/log/*/current\n\n### Still having problems? :crying_cat_face:\n\nYou probably found an error message or exception backtrace you could not resolve. Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues) and include as much information as you could gather about the problem your are experiencing.\n\n\n### Additional notes\n\nDebian Stretch switched from MySQL to [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). All packages with `mysql` in the name are just wrappers around the MariaDB ones, with some containing some compatibility symlinks. Huginn should also work fine with the MariaDB packages directly, although to keep the installation instructions more compact, they still use the MySQL packages.\n\n#### Set password for root MySQL user on Ubuntu\n\nMySQL installations (>= 5.7.26) on Ubuntu use the UNIX `auth_socket` plugin by default, such that authentication is handled by system user credientials. In order to access the MySQL root user from any system user, you have to set the MySQL root user password in the user database. Sign into the MySQL shell \n\n    sudo mysql -u root -p\n\n    # The default password upon installation is blank\n\nOnce in the MySQL shell, run the following command to set the password for the root user by replacing `new-password` with a password of your choice\n\n    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';\n\nAfter the change has been made, exit the MySQL shell with `\\q`. \n\nFor the change to propogate, restart the MySQL server\n\n    sudo service mysql restart\n",

[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Authentication System Overview\n\nHuginn implements a multi-layered authentication system:\n\n- **Session-based authentication** for web interface (using Devise)\n- **Secret-based authentication** for webhook endpoints\n- **User-scoped authorization** for all resources\n- **OAuth integration** for external services\n- **Invitation code system** for user registration\n\n### Core Security Principles\n\n- All resources are scoped to the authenticated user\n- Webhook endpoints require secret validation\n- CSRF protection for state-changing operations\n- OAuth integration for external service authentication\n- Account lockout protection against brute force attacks\n\n## Web Interface Authentication\n\n### Devise Configuration\n\nHuginn uses Devise with the following modules:\n\n```ruby\ndevise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,\n       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable,\n       :validatable, :lockable, :omniauthable,\n       *(:confirmable if ENV['REQUIRE_CONFIRMED_EMAIL'] == 'true')\n```\n\n### Authentication Features\n\n- **Username or Email Login**: Users can authenticate with either username or email\n- **Account Locking**: Configurable failed attempt limits (default: 10 attempts)\n- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters (configurable via `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH`)\n- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts\n- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent sessions with secure cookies in production\n\n### User Registration\n\nRegistration requires an invitation code system:\n\n```ruby\n# Environment configuration\nINVITATION_CODES = [ENV['INVITATION_CODE'] || 'try-huginn']\n\n# Skip invitation code requirement (development)\nENV['SKIP_INVITATION_CODE'] != 'true'\n```\n\n### Session Security\n\n**Production Configuration:**\n```ruby\n# Secure cookies in production\nconfig.rememberable_options = { secure: true }\n\n# Force SSL (optional)\nconfig.force_ssl = ENV['FORCE_SSL'] == 'true'\n```\n\n## Webhook Authentication\n\n### Web Request Endpoints\n\nHuginn provides webhook endpoints that bypass session authentication:\n\n```\nPOST/GET/PUT/DELETE /users/:user_id/web_requests/:agent_id/:secret\n```\n\n### Security Implementation\n\nThe `WebRequestsController` implements security through:\n\n```ruby\nclass WebRequestsController < ApplicationController\n  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token  # CSRF not applicable to webhooks\n  skip_before_action :authenticate_user!         # Uses secret-based auth instead\n  \n  def handle_request\n    user = User.find_by_id(params[:user_id])\n    agent = user.agents.find_by_id(params[:agent_id])\n    # Secret validation happens in agent's receive_web_request method\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Secret Validation Pattern\n\nEach agent that receives webhooks validates the secret:\n\n```ruby\n# Example from WebhookAgent\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  secret = request.path_parameters[:secret]\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless secret == interpolated['secret']\n  # Process request...\nend\n```\n\n### Secret Generation\n\nSecrets are typically generated using secure random values:\n\n```ruby\ndef default_options\n  {\n    \"secret\" => SecureRandom.uuid,\n    # other options...\n  }\nend\n```\n\n## API Endpoint Security\n\n### Resource-Scoped Authorization\n\nAll API endpoints enforce user-based authorization:\n\n**Agents Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef index\n  @agents = current_user.agents.page(params[:page])\nend\n\ndef show\n  @agent = current_user.agents.find(params[:id])\nend\n```\n\n**Events Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef index\n  @events = current_user.events.preload(:agent).page(params[:page])\nend\n```\n\n**Scenarios Controller:**\n```ruby\ndef show\n  @scenario = current_user.scenarios.find(params[:id])\nend\n```\n\n### Authentication Requirements\n\n| Endpoint | Authentication | Authorization |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|\n| `/agents` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/events` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/scenarios` | Session required | User-scoped |\n| `/scenarios/:id/export` | Optional* | Public scenarios or owner |\n| `/web_requests/:user_id/:agent_id/:secret` | Secret-based | Agent secret validation |\n\n*Public scenarios can be exported without authentication\n\n## Security Patterns\n\n### CSRF Protection\n\n**Default Protection:**\n```ruby\n# ApplicationController\nbefore_action :verify_authenticity_token  # Applied to all controllers\n```\n\n**Selective Bypass:**\n```ruby\n# WebRequestsController (webhooks don't need CSRF protection)\nskip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token\n```\n\n### Input Sanitization\n\n**HTML Sanitization:**\n```ruby\n# application.rb\nconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = %w[strong em b i p code pre ...]\nconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_attributes = %w[href src width height ...]\n```\n\n### Parameter Security\n\n**Strong Parameters:**\n```ruby\ndef agent_params\n  params[:agent].permit([:memory, :name, :type, :schedule, :disabled, \n                        :keep_events_for, :propagate_immediately, \n                        source_ids: [], receiver_ids: [], \n                        scenario_ids: []] + agent_params_options)\nend\n```\n\n### reCAPTCHA Integration\n\nWebhook agents can optionally integrate reCAPTCHA:\n\n```ruby\n# WebhookAgent reCAPTCHA validation\nif recaptcha_secret = interpolated['recaptcha_secret'].presence\n  # Validate reCAPTCHA response\n  response = faraday.post('https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify', {\n    secret: recaptcha_secret,\n    response: params.delete('g-recaptcha-response')\n  })\n  \n  body = JSON.parse(response.body)\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless body['success']\nend\n```\n\n### OAuth Security\n\nExternal service authentication uses OAuth with secure token storage:\n\n```ruby\n# Service model for OAuth tokens\nclass Service < ActiveRecord::Base\n  validates_presence_of :token\n  \n  def refresh_token!\n    # Secure token refresh implementation\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Secret Management\n\n**Generate Strong Secrets:**\n```ruby\n# Use cryptographically secure random values\nsecret = SecureRandom.uuid\nsecret = SecureRandom.hex(32)  # For longer secrets\n```\n\n**Secret Rotation:**\n- Regularly rotate webhook secrets\n- Update secrets in both Huginn and external services\n- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts\n\n### 2. User Credentials\n\n**Secure Storage:**\n```ruby\n# UserCredential model enforces validation\nvalidates :credential_name, presence: true, uniqueness: { scope: :user_id }\nvalidates :credential_value, presence: true\n```\n\n**Access Patterns:**\n```ruby\n# Agents access credentials securely\ndef credential(name)\n  user.user_credentials.where(credential_name: name).first&.credential_value\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Production Security\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n```bash\n# Essential security environment variables\nINVITATION_CODE=your-secure-invitation-code\nMIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=8\nFORCE_SSL=true\nRAILS_MASTER_KEY=your-master-key\n\n# OAuth credentials\nTWITTER_OAUTH_KEY=your-key\nTWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET=your-secret\n```\n\n**SSL/TLS Configuration:**\n```ruby\n# Force SSL in production\nconfig.force_ssl = true\n\n# Secure cookie configuration\nconfig.rememberable_options = { secure: true }\n```\n\n### 4. Webhook Security\n\n**Validate All Requests:**\n```ruby\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  # Always validate secret first\n  secret = request.path_parameters[:secret]\n  return [\"Not Authorized\", 401] unless secret == expected_secret\n  \n  # Validate HTTP method\n  allowed_methods = %w[post get put delete]\n  return [\"Method Not Allowed\", 405] unless allowed_methods.include?(request.method.downcase)\n  \n  # Process request...\nend\n```\n\n**IP Whitelisting (optional):**\n```ruby\n# In webhook agents, optionally validate source IP\ndef receive_web_request(request)\n  allowed_ips = %w[192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8]\n  client_ip = request.remote_ip\n  return [\"Forbidden\", 403] unless ip_allowed?(client_ip, allowed_ips)\nend\n```\n\n## Common Errors and Solutions\n\n### Authentication Errors\n\n**Error: \"Invalid login or password\"**\n- **Cause**: Incorrect username/email or password\n- **Solution**: Verify credentials, check account lockout status\n\n**Error: \"Account is locked\"**\n- **Cause**: Exceeded maximum failed login attempts\n- **Solution**: Wait for unlock timeout or contact admin for manual unlock\n\n**Error: \"Not Authorized\" (401) on webhooks**\n- **Cause**: Invalid or missing secret in webhook URL\n- **Solution**: Verify secret matches agent configuration\n\n### Authorization Errors\n\n**Error: \"Agent not found\" (404)**\n- **Cause**: Agent ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to user\n- **Solution**: Verify agent ownership and ID correctness\n\n**Error: \"Scenario not found\" (404)**\n- **Cause**: Scenario ID doesn't exist or user lacks access\n- **Solution**: Check scenario ownership or public status\n\n### CSRF Errors\n\n**Error: \"Invalid authenticity token\"**\n- **Cause**: Missing or invalid CSRF token in form submission\n- **Solution**: Ensure forms include `<%= csrf_meta_tags %>` and proper token handling\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Webhook Setup\n\n**Agent Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"abc123-secure-secret-xyz789\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n    \"response\": \"Event received\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-instance.com/users/1/web_requests/123/abc123-secure-secret-xyz789\n```\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://your-huginn-instance.com/users/1/web_requests/123/abc123-secure-secret-xyz789 \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello from external service\"}'\n```\n\n### 2. API Authentication\n\n**Session-based API Request:**\n```bash\n# Login first to establish session\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn-instance.com/users/sign_in \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"user\": {\"login\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\"}}' \\\n  -c cookies.txt\n\n# Make authenticated API request\ncurl -X GET https://your-huginn-instance.com/agents.json \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -b cookies.txt\n```\n\n### 3. OAuth Service Integration\n\n**Service Creation Flow:**\n1. User initiates OAuth flow: `/auth/twitter`\n2. External service redirects back: `/auth/twitter/callback`\n3. Huginn creates/updates service record with tokens\n4. Agents can use service for authenticated requests\n\n### 4. User Credential Management\n\n**Creating Credentials:**\n```ruby\n# Via web interface or programmatically\nuser.user_credentials.create!(\n  credential_name: \"api_key\", \n  credential_value: \"secret-api-key-value\"\n)\n```\n\n**Using Credentials in Agents:**\n```ruby\ndef check\n  api_key = credential(\"api_key\")\n  return error(\"API key not found\") unless api_key\n  \n  # Use api_key for external service requests\nend\n```\n\n## Security Monitoring\n\n### Logging\n\nHuginn logs authentication events and security-relevant activities:\n\n- Failed login attempts\n- Account lockouts\n- Webhook request processing\n- Agent execution errors\n\n### Monitoring Recommendations\n\n1. **Monitor failed authentication attempts**\n2. **Set up alerts for account lockouts**\n3. **Track webhook endpoint access patterns**\n4. **Review agent logs for security errors**\n5. **Monitor OAuth token refresh activities**\n\n---\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to Huginn's authentication and security systems.

Authentication\n\nMost API endpoints require session-based authentication through Devise. Login through the web interface first to establish a session, then use the session cookie in your API requests.\n\n```bash\n# Login first through web interface, then use the session cookie\ncurl -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session-cookie\" \\\n     https://your-huginn.com/agents\n```\n\n### 2. Webhooks (No Authentication Required)\n\nWebhook endpoints use secret-based authentication and don't require sessions:\n\n```bash\n# Send webhook data to an agent\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/your-secret \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"event\": \"user_signup\", \"email\": \"user@example.com\"}'\n```\n\n### 3. Common Operations\n\n#### List Your Agents\n```bash\nGET /agents\n```\n\n#### Create a WebhookAgent\n```bash\nPOST /agents\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Webhook Agent\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"my-secret-token\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get RSS Feed from DataOutputAgent\n```bash\nGET /users/1/web_requests/456/feed-secret?format=xml\n```\n\n## API Specification\n\nThe complete API specification is available in OpenAPI 3.0 format at `openapi.yaml`. You can:\n\n1. **View in Swagger UI**: Import the YAML file into [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)\n2. **Generate Client Libraries**: Use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to create client libraries in your preferred language\n3. **Import into Postman**: Import the OpenAPI spec directly into Postman for testing\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Webhook System\n- **Multiple HTTP Verbs**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- **Secret Authentication**: Each agent uses a configurable secret token\n- **Flexible Payloads**: JSON, form data, and multipart support\n- **Custom Responses**: Agents can return custom content and HTTP status codes\n\n### Agent Management\n- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete agents\n- **Runtime Control**: Manually run agents, clear memory, re-emit events\n- **Type Discovery**: Get agent type details and validation\n- **Scenario Organization**: Group agents into scenarios\n\n### Event Handling\n- **Event Streams**: Monitor events across all agents\n- **Re-emission**: Re-trigger events for downstream processing\n- **Filtering**: Filter events by agent or time period\n\n### Background Jobs\n- **Job Monitoring**: View delayed job queue (admin only)\n- **Job Control**: Retry, delete, or manually run jobs\n- **System Status**: Monitor worker health and performance\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Secret Tokens**: Use strong, unique secrets for webhook agents\n2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting for API calls\n4. **Validation**: Validate all webhook payloads in your agents\n5. **Secrets Management**: Store API secrets securely, not in code\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes:\n\n- **200/201**: Success\n- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid session or secret)\n- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)\n- **404**: Not Found\n- **422**: Validation Error\n- **500**: Server Error\n\nError responses include descriptive messages in the response body.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee `integration-guide.md` for detailed examples and integration patterns for common use cases including:\n\n- Setting up webhook endpoints\n- Creating data processing pipelines  \n- Building RSS/JSON feeds\n- Integrating with external services\n- Monitoring and alerting\n\n## Support\n\nFor questions and support:\n\n- **Documentation**: [Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki)\n- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/issues)\n- **Community**: [Huginn Discussions](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/discussions)"

    "content": "# Huginn Webhook Usage Examples and Patterns\n\nThis comprehensive guide provides production-ready examples for using webhooks in Huginn, covering both WebhookAgent (incoming webhooks) and DataOutputAgent (outgoing data feeds).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [WebhookAgent Examples](#webhookagent-examples)\n- [DataOutputAgent Examples](#dataoutputagent-examples) \n- [Real-World Integration Scenarios](#real-world-integration-scenarios)\n- [Code Examples](#code-examples)\n- [Advanced Patterns](#advanced-patterns)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Testing and Validation](#testing-and-validation)\n\n## WebhookAgent Examples\n\nThe WebhookAgent creates events by receiving HTTP requests (webhooks) from external sources.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"your-secure-random-token-here\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL Format:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n### 1. GitHub Webhook Integration\n\nPerfect for monitoring repository events, pull requests, and issues.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret-xyz789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-GitHub-Event,X-GitHub-Delivery,User-Agent\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"github_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Webhook received successfully\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### GitHub Webhook Setup\n1. Go to your repository's Settings → Webhooks\n2. Add webhook with URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/github-webhook-secret-xyz789`\n3. Select \"application/json\" content type\n4. Choose events: Push, Pull requests, Issues\n\n#### Sample Payload Processing\nThe webhook will create events with this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"opened\",\n  \"pull_request\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix critical bug in authentication\",\n    \"user\": {\"login\": \"developer\"},\n    \"base\": {\"ref\": \"main\"},\n    \"head\": {\"ref\": \"fix/auth-bug\"}\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"name\": \"my-project\",\n    \"full_name\": \"org/my-project\"\n  },\n  \"github_headers\": {\n    \"X-GitHub-Event\": \"pull_request\",\n    \"X-GitHub-Delivery\": \"unique-delivery-id\",\n    \"User-Agent\": \"GitHub-Hookshot/abc123\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Slack Webhook Integration\n\nReceive notifications and commands from Slack.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"slack-webhook-token-abc123\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"User-Agent,X-Slack-Signature\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"slack_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Message processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Slack App Setup\n1. Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps\n2. Enable Event Subscriptions\n3. Set Request URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/slack-webhook-token-abc123`\n4. Subscribe to events: `message.channels`, `app_mention`\n\n### 3. IoT Device Data Collection\n\nCollect sensor data from IoT devices or services.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"iot-sensor-key-def456\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"sensor_data\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-Device-ID,X-Sensor-Type\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"device_info\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,put\",\n  \"response\": \"Data recorded\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Expected JSON Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-03T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"device_id\": \"temp-sensor-01\",\n  \"sensor_data\": {\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"battery_level\": 87,\n    \"location\": {\n      \"latitude\": 40.7128,\n      \"longitude\": -74.0060\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Multiple Event Creation from Arrays\n\nProcess webhooks that contain arrays of data, creating separate events for each item.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"batch-processor-ghi789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"items\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"{{items.size}} events created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Input Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"batch_id\": \"batch_20250903_001\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Product A\", \"price\": 29.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Product B\", \"price\": 39.99},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Product C\", \"price\": 19.99}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create 3 separate events, one for each item in the array.\n\n### 5. Custom Response Headers and CORS\n\nEnable cross-origin requests with custom response headers.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"cors-enabled-webhook-jkl012\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,options\",\n  \"response\": \"Success\",\n  \"code\": \"200\",\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n    \"Access-Control-Max-Age\": \"86400\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nAdd bot protection to your webhooks using Google reCAPTCHA.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"protected-webhook-mno345\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n  \"response\": \"Verified and processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n## DataOutputAgent Examples\n\nThe DataOutputAgent outputs received events as RSS or JSON feeds accessible via HTTP.\n\n### Basic RSS Feed Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"rss-feed-token-abc123\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"My Huginn Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest events from my Huginn agents\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-blog.com\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 50,\n  \"ttl\": 60\n}\n```\n\n**Access URLs:**\n- RSS: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.xml`\n- JSON: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.json`\n\n### 1.

Webhook Chaining and Event Flow\n\nCreate complex workflows by chaining multiple webhook endpoints.\n\n#### Primary Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Initial Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-start-abc123\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Processing initiated\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Processing Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Processor\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    // Add processing metadata\\n    var processed = {\\n      original_data: event,\\n      processed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_id: 'proc_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),\\n      status: 'processed'\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(processed);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Notification Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Notification Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-notify-def456\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Notification sent\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Data Transformation Pipelines\n\nTransform incoming data through multiple stages.\n\n#### Schema Validation Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Schema Validator\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var isValid = true;\\n    var errors = [];\\n    \\n    // Validate required fields\\n    if (!event.user_id) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing user_id');\\n    }\\n    \\n    if (!event.timestamp) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing timestamp');\\n    }\\n    \\n    var result = {\\n      original_event: event,\\n      validation: {\\n        is_valid: isValid,\\n        errors: errors,\\n        validated_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      }\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(result);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Data Enrichment Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Enricher\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    if (event.validation.is_valid) {\\n      var enriched = event.original_event;\\n      \\n      // Add computed fields\\n      enriched.day_of_week = new Date(enriched.timestamp).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {weekday: 'long'});\\n      enriched.hour_of_day = new Date(enriched.timestamp).getHours();\\n      enriched.enriched_at = new Date().toISOString();\\n      \\n      this.createEvent(enriched);\\n    } else {\\n      console.log('Skipping invalid event:', event.validation.errors);\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImplement robust error handling for webhook processing.\n\n#### Error Capture Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Error Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    try {\\n      // Attempt processing\\n      var processed = processData(event);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'success',\\n        data: processed,\\n        processed_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      });\\n      \\n    } catch (error) {\\n      // Log error and create error event\\n      console.log('Processing error:', error.message);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'error',\\n        error_message: error.message,\\n        original_event: event,\\n        failed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n        retry_count: event.retry_count || 0\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n  \\n  function processData(data) {\\n    // Your processing logic here\\n    if (!data.required_field) {\\n      throw new Error('Missing required field');\\n    }\\n    return { processed: true, result: data.required_field.toUpperCase() };\\n  }\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Retry Logic Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Retry Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::TriggerAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rules\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field==value\",\n        \"value\": \"error\",\n        \"path\": \"status\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field<value\",\n        \"value\": \"3\",\n        \"path\": \"retry_count\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"message\": \"Retrying failed event (attempt {{retry_count + 1}})\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Logging Practices\n\nImplement comprehensive monitoring for your webhook infrastructure.\n\n#### Metrics Collection Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Metrics\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var metrics = {\\n      event_type: event.type || 'unknown',\\n      source: event.headers ? event.headers['User-Agent'] : 'unknown',\\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_time: Date.now() - new Date(event.received_at || event.created_at).getTime(),\\n      payload_size: JSON.stringify(event).length,\\n      success: true\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(metrics);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Log Aggregation Feed\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Logs Feed\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"webhook-logs-vwx234\"],\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"Webhook Processing Logs\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time webhook processing metrics and logs\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{event_type}} from {{source}}\",\n        \"description\": \"Processing time: {{processing_time}}ms | Size: {{payload_size}} bytes\",\n        \"category\": \"{{success ? 'success' : 'error'}}\",\n        \"processing_time\": \"{{processing_time}}\",\n        \"payload_size\": \"{{payload_size}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"events_to_show\": 500\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" Error (401)\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect secret in URL or webhook configuration\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret matches exactly between webhook URL and agent configuration\n- Check for leading/trailing spaces in the secret\n- Ensure the secret doesn't contain special characters that need URL encoding\n- Test with a simple secret like `test123` first\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}' -v\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" Error (404)\n\n**Cause:** Invalid agent ID or user ID in URL\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the agent ID in your Huginn dashboard\n- Ensure the user ID is correct\n- Check that the agent is active and not deleted\n\n#### 3. Events Not Being Created\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n**Incorrect `payload_path`:**\n```json\n// If your JSON is: {\"data\": {\"items\": [1,2,3]}}\n// Use payload_path: \"data.items\" to create 3 events\n// Use payload_path: \"data\" to create 1 event with the data object\n// Use payload_path: \".\" to create 1 event with entire payload\n```\n\n**HTTP Method Not Allowed:**\n```json\n{\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get,put\"  // Specify allowed HTTP methods\n}\n```\n\n**Payload Processing Errors:**\n- Check agent logs for error messages\n- Verify JSON structure matches expected format\n- Test with simplified payloads first\n\n#### 4. RSS/JSON Feed Not Loading\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect feed URL or secret\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret is in the `secrets` array\n- Check the feed URL format: `/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}`\n- Test the agent has received events recently\n- Verify `expected_receive_period_in_days` hasn't expired\n\n#### 5. CORS Issues with Browser Requests\n\n**Solution:** Add CORS headers to webhook response\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, GET, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 6. Large Payloads Causing Timeouts\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Break large payloads into smaller chunks\n- Use `payload_path` to extract specific data portions\n- Implement pagination for data feeds\n- Consider using background job processing\n\n#### 7. reCAPTCHA Verification Failing\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- Wrong reCAPTCHA secret key\n- Missing `g-recaptcha-response` in payload\n- Score threshold too high for reCAPTCHA v3\n\n**Solution:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-secret-key-from-google\",\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.3,  // Lower threshold for more lenient verification\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n#### 1. Test with Simple Payload\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secret \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"hello\"}' \\\n  -v\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Agent Logs\n- Go to your agent's page in Huginn\n- Click on \"Logs\" tab\n- Look for error messages and processing information\n\n#### 3. Verify Event Creation\n- Check the agent's \"Events\" tab\n- Look for recently created events\n- Verify event payload structure\n\n#### 4. Test Feed URLs\n```bash\n# Test RSS feed\ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.xml -v\n\n# Test JSON feed  \ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.json -v\n```\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### WebhookAgent Testing\n\n#### 1.

    "content": "# Huginn Webhook Usage Examples and Patterns\n\nThis comprehensive guide provides production-ready examples for using webhooks in Huginn, covering both WebhookAgent (incoming webhooks) and DataOutputAgent (outgoing data feeds).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [WebhookAgent Examples](#webhookagent-examples)\n- [DataOutputAgent Examples](#dataoutputagent-examples) \n- [Real-World Integration Scenarios](#real-world-integration-scenarios)\n- [Code Examples](#code-examples)\n- [Advanced Patterns](#advanced-patterns)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Testing and Validation](#testing-and-validation)\n\n## WebhookAgent Examples\n\nThe WebhookAgent creates events by receiving HTTP requests (webhooks) from external sources.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"your-secure-random-token-here\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook URL Format:**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n### 1. GitHub Webhook Integration\n\nPerfect for monitoring repository events, pull requests, and issues.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret-xyz789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-GitHub-Event,X-GitHub-Delivery,User-Agent\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"github_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Webhook received successfully\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### GitHub Webhook Setup\n1. Go to your repository's Settings → Webhooks\n2. Add webhook with URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/github-webhook-secret-xyz789`\n3. Select \"application/json\" content type\n4. Choose events: Push, Pull requests, Issues\n\n#### Sample Payload Processing\nThe webhook will create events with this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"opened\",\n  \"pull_request\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix critical bug in authentication\",\n    \"user\": {\"login\": \"developer\"},\n    \"base\": {\"ref\": \"main\"},\n    \"head\": {\"ref\": \"fix/auth-bug\"}\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"name\": \"my-project\",\n    \"full_name\": \"org/my-project\"\n  },\n  \"github_headers\": {\n    \"X-GitHub-Event\": \"pull_request\",\n    \"X-GitHub-Delivery\": \"unique-delivery-id\",\n    \"User-Agent\": \"GitHub-Hookshot/abc123\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Slack Webhook Integration\n\nReceive notifications and commands from Slack.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"slack-webhook-token-abc123\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"User-Agent,X-Slack-Signature\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"slack_headers\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"Message processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Slack App Setup\n1. Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps\n2. Enable Event Subscriptions\n3. Set Request URL: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/slack-webhook-token-abc123`\n4. Subscribe to events: `message.channels`, `app_mention`\n\n### 3. IoT Device Data Collection\n\nCollect sensor data from IoT devices or services.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"iot-sensor-key-def456\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"sensor_data\",\n  \"event_headers\": \"X-Device-ID,X-Sensor-Type\",\n  \"event_headers_key\": \"device_info\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,put\",\n  \"response\": \"Data recorded\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Expected JSON Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-03T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"device_id\": \"temp-sensor-01\",\n  \"sensor_data\": {\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"battery_level\": 87,\n    \"location\": {\n      \"latitude\": 40.7128,\n      \"longitude\": -74.0060\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Multiple Event Creation from Arrays\n\nProcess webhooks that contain arrays of data, creating separate events for each item.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"batch-processor-ghi789\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"payload_path\": \"items\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"response\": \"{{items.size}} events created\",\n  \"code\": \"201\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Input Payload\n```json\n{\n  \"batch_id\": \"batch_20250903_001\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Product A\", \"price\": 29.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Product B\", \"price\": 39.99},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Product C\", \"price\": 19.99}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create 3 separate events, one for each item in the array.\n\n### 5. Custom Response Headers and CORS\n\nEnable cross-origin requests with custom response headers.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"cors-enabled-webhook-jkl012\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,options\",\n  \"response\": \"Success\",\n  \"code\": \"200\",\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n    \"Access-Control-Max-Age\": \"86400\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nAdd bot protection to your webhooks using Google reCAPTCHA.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"protected-webhook-mno345\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 30,\n  \"payload_path\": \".\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post\",\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n  \"response\": \"Verified and processed\",\n  \"code\": \"200\"\n}\n```\n\n## DataOutputAgent Examples\n\nThe DataOutputAgent outputs received events as RSS or JSON feeds accessible via HTTP.\n\n### Basic RSS Feed Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"rss-feed-token-abc123\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"My Huginn Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest events from my Huginn agents\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-blog.com\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 50,\n  \"ttl\": 60\n}\n```\n\n**Access URLs:**\n- RSS: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.xml`\n- JSON: `https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/rss-feed-token-abc123.json`\n\n### 1. News Feed Aggregator\n\nCreate RSS feed from multiple news sources.\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n```json\n{\n  \"secrets\": [\"news-aggregator-xyz789\"],\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"Tech News Aggregator\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest technology news from multiple sources\",\n    \"link\": \"https://my-tech-blog.com\",\n    \"icon\": \"https://my-tech-blog.com/favicon.ico\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{summary}} Source: {{source}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"pubDate\": \"{{published_at}}\",\n      \"author\": \"{{author}}\",\n      \"category\": \"{{category}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"events_to_show\": 100,\n  \"ttl\": 30,\n  \"ns_media\": true,\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Cache-Control\": \"public, max-age=1800\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

Webhook Chaining and Event Flow\n\nCreate complex workflows by chaining multiple webhook endpoints.\n\n#### Primary Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Initial Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-start-abc123\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Processing initiated\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Processing Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Processor\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    // Add processing metadata\\n    var processed = {\\n      original_data: event,\\n      processed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_id: 'proc_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),\\n      status: 'processed'\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(processed);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Notification Webhook Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Notification Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"chain-notify-def456\",\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"response\": \"Notification sent\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Data Transformation Pipelines\n\nTransform incoming data through multiple stages.\n\n#### Schema Validation Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Schema Validator\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var isValid = true;\\n    var errors = [];\\n    \\n    // Validate required fields\\n    if (!event.user_id) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing user_id');\\n    }\\n    \\n    if (!event.timestamp) {\\n      isValid = false;\\n      errors.push('Missing timestamp');\\n    }\\n    \\n    var result = {\\n      original_event: event,\\n      validation: {\\n        is_valid: isValid,\\n        errors: errors,\\n        validated_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      }\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(result);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Data Enrichment Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Data Enricher\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    if (event.validation.is_valid) {\\n      var enriched = event.original_event;\\n      \\n      // Add computed fields\\n      enriched.day_of_week = new Date(enriched.timestamp).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {weekday: 'long'});\\n      enriched.hour_of_day = new Date(enriched.timestamp).getHours();\\n      enriched.enriched_at = new Date().toISOString();\\n      \\n      this.createEvent(enriched);\\n    } else {\\n      console.log('Skipping invalid event:', event.validation.errors);\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImplement robust error handling for webhook processing.\n\n#### Error Capture Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Error Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    try {\\n      // Attempt processing\\n      var processed = processData(event);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'success',\\n        data: processed,\\n        processed_at: new Date().toISOString()\\n      });\\n      \\n    } catch (error) {\\n      // Log error and create error event\\n      console.log('Processing error:', error.message);\\n      \\n      this.createEvent({\\n        status: 'error',\\n        error_message: error.message,\\n        original_event: event,\\n        failed_at: new Date().toISOString(),\\n        retry_count: event.retry_count || 0\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }.bind(this));\\n  \\n  function processData(data) {\\n    // Your processing logic here\\n    if (!data.required_field) {\\n      throw new Error('Missing required field');\\n    }\\n    return { processed: true, result: data.required_field.toUpperCase() };\\n  }\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Retry Logic Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Retry Handler\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::TriggerAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rules\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field==value\",\n        \"value\": \"error\",\n        \"path\": \"status\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"field<value\",\n        \"value\": \"3\",\n        \"path\": \"retry_count\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"message\": \"Retrying failed event (attempt {{retry_count + 1}})\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Logging Practices\n\nImplement comprehensive monitoring for your webhook infrastructure.\n\n#### Metrics Collection Agent\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Metrics\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::JavaScriptAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"code\": \"Agent.check = function() {\\n  this.incomingEvents().forEach(function(event) {\\n    var metrics = {\\n      event_type: event.type || 'unknown',\\n      source: event.headers ? event.headers['User-Agent'] : 'unknown',\\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\\n      processing_time: Date.now() - new Date(event.received_at || event.created_at).getTime(),\\n      payload_size: JSON.stringify(event).length,\\n      success: true\\n    };\\n    \\n    this.createEvent(metrics);\\n  }.bind(this));\\n};\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Log Aggregation Feed\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Webhook Logs Feed\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"webhook-logs-vwx234\"],\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"Webhook Processing Logs\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time webhook processing metrics and logs\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{event_type}} from {{source}}\",\n        \"description\": \"Processing time: {{processing_time}}ms | Size: {{payload_size}} bytes\",\n        \"category\": \"{{success ? 'success' : 'error'}}\",\n        \"processing_time\": \"{{processing_time}}\",\n        \"payload_size\": \"{{payload_size}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"events_to_show\": 500\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" Error (401)\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect secret in URL or webhook configuration\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret matches exactly between webhook URL and agent configuration\n- Check for leading/trailing spaces in the secret\n- Ensure the secret doesn't contain special characters that need URL encoding\n- Test with a simple secret like `test123` first\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}' -v\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" Error (404)\n\n**Cause:** Invalid agent ID or user ID in URL\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the agent ID in your Huginn dashboard\n- Ensure the user ID is correct\n- Check that the agent is active and not deleted\n\n#### 3. Events Not Being Created\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n**Incorrect `payload_path`:**\n```json\n// If your JSON is: {\"data\": {\"items\": [1,2,3]}}\n// Use payload_path: \"data.items\" to create 3 events\n// Use payload_path: \"data\" to create 1 event with the data object\n// Use payload_path: \".\" to create 1 event with entire payload\n```\n\n**HTTP Method Not Allowed:**\n```json\n{\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get,put\"  // Specify allowed HTTP methods\n}\n```\n\n**Payload Processing Errors:**\n- Check agent logs for error messages\n- Verify JSON structure matches expected format\n- Test with simplified payloads first\n\n#### 4. RSS/JSON Feed Not Loading\n\n**Cause:** Incorrect feed URL or secret\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Verify the secret is in the `secrets` array\n- Check the feed URL format: `/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}`\n- Test the agent has received events recently\n- Verify `expected_receive_period_in_days` hasn't expired\n\n#### 5. CORS Issues with Browser Requests\n\n**Solution:** Add CORS headers to webhook response\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST, GET, OPTIONS\",\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Authorization\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 6. Large Payloads Causing Timeouts\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Break large payloads into smaller chunks\n- Use `payload_path` to extract specific data portions\n- Implement pagination for data feeds\n- Consider using background job processing\n\n#### 7. reCAPTCHA Verification Failing\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- Wrong reCAPTCHA secret key\n- Missing `g-recaptcha-response` in payload\n- Score threshold too high for reCAPTCHA v3\n\n**Solution:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-secret-key-from-google\",\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.3,  // Lower threshold for more lenient verification\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n#### 1. Test with Simple Payload\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secret \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"hello\"}' \\\n  -v\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Agent Logs\n- Go to your agent's page in Huginn\n- Click on \"Logs\" tab\n- Look for error messages and processing information\n\n#### 3. Verify Event Creation\n- Check the agent's \"Events\" tab\n- Look for recently created events\n- Verify event payload structure\n\n#### 4. Test Feed URLs\n```bash\n# Test RSS feed\ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.xml -v\n\n# Test JSON feed  \ncurl https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret.json -v\n```\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### WebhookAgent Testing\n\n#### 1.

The simplest approach is to use session cookies:\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript example using fetch\nconst login = async (email, password) => {\n  const response = await fetch('/users/sign_in', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'X-CSRF-Token': getCSRFToken(),\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      user: { email, password }\n    }),\n    credentials: 'include' // Include cookies\n  });\n  \n  if (response.ok) {\n    console.log('Logged in successfully');\n  }\n};\n\n// Use authenticated session for subsequent requests\nconst getAgents = async () => {\n  const response = await fetch('/agents', {\n    credentials: 'include'\n  });\n  return response.json();\n};\n```\n\n### Webhook Authentication (No Session Required)\n\nWebhooks use secret-based authentication:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef send_webhook(user_id, agent_id, secret, data):\n    \"\"\"Send data to a Huginn webhook agent\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://your-huginn.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n    \n    response = requests.post(\n        url,\n        json=data,\n        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    )\n    \n    if response.status_code == 201:\n        print(\"Webhook sent successfully\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Webhook failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n    \n    return response\n\n# Example usage\nwebhook_data = {\n    \"event_type\": \"user_registration\",\n    \"user\": {\n        \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\"\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\n}\n\nsend_webhook(1, 123, \"your-secret-token\", webhook_data)\n```\n\n## Webhook Integration Patterns\n\n### 1. Basic Webhook Receiver\n\nCreate a WebhookAgent to receive external data:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/agents \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"GitHub Webhook Receiver\",\n    \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret\",\n      \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n      \"payload_path\": \".\",\n      \"verbs\": \"post\",\n      \"response\": \"Webhook received\",\n      \"code\": \"200\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### 2. Multi-Source Data Collector\n\nCollect data from multiple sources using different secrets:\n\n```javascript\nclass HuginnWebhookCollector {\n  constructor(baseUrl, userId, agentId) {\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n    this.userId = userId;\n    this.agentId = agentId;\n  }\n\n  async sendData(source, secret, data) {\n    const url = `${this.baseUrl}/users/${this.userId}/web_requests/${this.agentId}/${secret}`;\n    \n    const payload = {\n      source: source,\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n      data: data\n    };\n\n    const response = await fetch(url, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(payload)\n    });\n\n    return response.ok;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst collector = new HuginnWebhookCollector('https://your-huginn.com', 1, 123);\n\n// Collect from different sources\nawait collector.sendData('shopify', 'shopify-secret', { order_id: 12345 });\nawait collector.sendData('stripe', 'stripe-secret', { payment_id: 67890 });\nawait collector.sendData('mailchimp', 'mailchimp-secret', { subscriber: 'user@example.com' });\n```\n\n### 3. Webhook with reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nFor public-facing webhooks, add reCAPTCHA protection:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Contact Form Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"contact-form-secret\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n    \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n    \"response\": \"Message received, thank you!\",\n    \"response_headers\": {\n      \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Agent Management\n\n### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation\n\nCreate agents programmatically based on configuration:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nclass HuginnAgentManager:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, session_cookie):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        self.headers = {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            'Cookie': f'_huginn_session={session_cookie}'\n        }\n    \n    def create_webhook_agent(self, name, secret, payload_path=\".\", verbs=\"post\"):\n        \"\"\"Create a new webhook agent\"\"\"\n        agent_data = {\n            \"name\": name,\n            \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"secret\": secret,\n                \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n                \"payload_path\": payload_path,\n                \"verbs\": verbs,\n                \"response\": \"Event created\"\n            }\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.post(\n            f\"{self.base_url}/agents\",\n            headers=self.headers,\n            json=agent_data\n        )\n        \n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            agent = response.json()\n            print(f\"Created agent: {agent['name']} (ID: {agent['id']})\")\n            return agent\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to create agent: {response.text}\")\n            return None\n    \n    def create_data_output_agent(self, name, secrets, template):\n        \"\"\"Create a new data output agent for RSS/JSON feeds\"\"\"\n        agent_data = {\n            \"name\": name,\n            \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"secrets\": secrets,\n                \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n                \"template\": template,\n                \"events_to_show\": 20\n            }\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.post(\n            f\"{self.base_url}/agents\",\n            headers=self.headers,\n            json=agent_data\n        )\n        \n        return response.json() if response.ok else None\n\n# Usage example\nmanager = HuginnAgentManager('https://your-huginn.com', 'your-session-cookie')\n\n# Create webhook receiver\nwebhook_agent = manager.create_webhook_agent(\n    \"API Data Receiver\",\n    \"api-data-secret\"\n)\n\n# Create RSS feed generator\nrss_template = {\n    \"title\": \"My Data Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Real-time data updates\",\n    \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n        \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n        \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n        \"pubDate\": \"{{timestamp}}\"\n    }\n}\n\nrss_agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n    \"Data RSS Feed\",\n    [\"rss-feed-secret\"],\n    rss_template\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Agent Configuration Management\n\nUpdate agent configurations dynamically:\n\n```javascript\nclass AgentConfigManager {\n  constructor(baseUrl, sessionCookie) {\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n    this.headers = {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Cookie': `_huginn_session=${sessionCookie}`\n    };\n  }\n\n  async updateAgentOptions(agentId, newOptions) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/agents/${agentId}`, {\n      method: 'PUT',\n      headers: this.headers,\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        options: newOptions\n      })\n    });\n\n    return response.ok;\n  }\n\n  async enableAgent(agentId) {\n    return this.updateAgentOptions(agentId, { disabled: false });\n  }\n\n  async disableAgent(agentId) {\n    return this.updateAgentOptions(agentId, { disabled: true });\n  }\n\n  async runAgent(agentId) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/agents/${agentId}/run`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: this.headers\n    });\n    \n    return response.ok;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Data Processing Pipelines\n\n### 1. Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline\n\nCreate a pipeline where each agent processes data and passes it to the next:\n\n```python\ndef create_processing_pipeline(manager):\n    \"\"\"Create a multi-stage data processing pipeline\"\"\"\n    \n    # Stage 1: Data Ingestion\n    ingestion_agent = manager.create_webhook_agent(\n        \"Data Ingestion\",\n        \"ingestion-secret\",\n        \".\",  # Take full payload\n        \"post\"\n    )\n    \n    # Stage 2: Data Transformation (would be a custom agent)\n    # Stage 3: Data Output\n    output_template = {\n        \"title\": \"Processed Data Feed\",\n        \"description\": \"Transformed data from pipeline\",\n        \"item\": {\n            \"title\": \"{{processed_title}}\",\n            \"description\": \"{{summary}}\",\n            \"category\": \"{{category}}\",\n            \"pubDate\": \"{{processing_date}}\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    output_agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n        \"Pipeline Output\",\n        [\"pipeline-output-secret\"],\n        output_template\n    )\n    \n    return ingestion_agent, output_agent\n\n# Connect agents in pipeline (would require additional agent configuration)\n```\n\n### 2. Event Filtering and Routing\n\n```javascript\n// Monitor events and route based on content\nclass EventRouter {\n  constructor(huginnApi) {\n    this.api = huginnApi;\n  }\n\n  async routeEvents(sourceAgentId) {\n    const events = await this.api.getAgentEvents(sourceAgentId);\n    \n    for (const event of events) {\n      const category = this.categorizeEvent(event.payload);\n      await this.routeToCategory(event, category);\n    }\n  }\n\n  categorizeEvent(payload) {\n    // Custom logic to categorize events\n    if (payload.priority === 'high') return 'alerts';\n    if (payload.type === 'user_action') return 'analytics';\n    return 'general';\n  }\n\n  async routeToCategory(event, category) {\n    const webhookUrl = this.getCategoryWebhook(category);\n    // Send to appropriate webhook endpoint\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## RSS/JSON Feed Integration\n\n### 1. Creating Dynamic RSS Feeds\n\n```python\ndef create_news_aggregator_feed(manager):\n    \"\"\"Create an RSS feed that aggregates news from multiple sources\"\"\"\n    \n    template = {\n        \"title\": \"My News Aggregator\",\n        \"description\": \"Curated news from multiple sources\",\n        \"link\": \"https://your-domain.com\",\n        \"item\": {\n            \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n            \"description\": \"{{summary | truncate: 200}}\",\n            \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n            \"category\": \"{{source}}\",\n            \"author\": \"{{author}}\",\n            \"pubDate\": \"{{published_date}}\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n        \"News Aggregator Feed\",\n        [\"news-feed-public\", \"news-feed-private\"],\n        template\n    )\n    \n    return agent\n\n# Access the feed\n# Public RSS: https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/news-feed-public.xml\n# Private JSON: https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/news-feed-private.json\n```\n\n### 2. Consuming Huginn Feeds\n\n```javascript\nclass HuginnFeedConsumer {\n  constructor(feedUrl) {\n    this.feedUrl = feedUrl;\n  }\n\n  async getRSSFeed() {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.feedUrl}.xml`);\n    const rssXml = await response.text();\n    \n    // Parse RSS XML (using a library like 'fast-xml-parser')\n    return this.parseRSS(rssXml);\n  }\n\n  async getJSONFeed() {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.feedUrl}.json`);\n    return response.json();\n  }\n\n  async getLatestItems(count = 10) {\n    const feed = await this.getJSONFeed();\n    return feed.items.slice(0, count);\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst consumer = new HuginnFeedConsumer(\n  'https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/your-secret'\n);\n\nconst latestNews = await consumer.getLatestItems(5);\nconsole.log('Latest news items:', latestNews);\n```\n\n## Event Monitoring\n\n### 1.

Event Analytics\n\n```javascript\nclass EventAnalytics {\n  constructor(huginnApi) {\n    this.api = huginnApi;\n  }\n\n  async getEventStats(days = 7) {\n    const cutoff = new Date();\n    cutoff.setDate(cutoff.getDate() - days);\n    \n    const events = await this.api.getAllEvents();\n    const recentEvents = events.filter(e => \n      new Date(e.created_at) > cutoff\n    );\n\n    return {\n      total: recentEvents.length,\n      byAgent: this.groupByAgent(recentEvents),\n      byDay: this.groupByDay(recentEvents),\n      averagePerDay: recentEvents.length / days\n    };\n  }\n\n  groupByAgent(events) {\n    return events.reduce((acc, event) => {\n      acc[event.agent_id] = (acc[event.agent_id] || 0) + 1;\n      return acc;\n    }, {});\n  }\n\n  groupByDay(events) {\n    return events.reduce((acc, event) => {\n      const day = new Date(event.created_at).toISOString().split('T')[0];\n      acc[day] = (acc[day] || 0) + 1;\n      return acc;\n    }, {});\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling Strategies\n\n### 1.

Secure Secret Management\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport secrets\nimport hashlib\n\nclass SecureSecretManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.secrets_file = os.getenv('HUGINN_SECRETS_FILE', 'secrets.env')\n    \n    def generate_secret(self, length=32):\n        \"\"\"Generate a cryptographically secure secret\"\"\"\n        return secrets.token_urlsafe(length)\n    \n    def hash_secret(self, secret):\n        \"\"\"Hash a secret for storage comparison\"\"\"\n        return hashlib.sha256(secret.encode()).hexdigest()\n    \n    def validate_webhook_signature(self, payload, signature, secret):\n        \"\"\"Validate webhook signature (if implementing HMAC)\"\"\"\n        expected = hashlib.sha256(\n            (payload + secret).encode()\n        ).hexdigest()\n        return signature == expected\n\n# Environment variable management\ndef get_agent_secret(agent_name):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve agent secret from environment variables\"\"\"\n    return os.getenv(f'HUGINN_SECRET_{agent_name.upper()}')\n\ndef create_secure_webhook_agent(manager, name):\n    \"\"\"Create webhook agent with secure secret\"\"\"\n    secret_manager = SecureSecretManager()\n    secret = secret_manager.generate_secret()\n    \n    # Store secret securely (not in code!)\n    os.environ[f'HUGINN_SECRET_{name.upper()}'] = secret\n    \n    return manager.create_webhook_agent(name, secret)\n```\n\n### 2. Request Validation and Sanitization\n\n```javascript\nclass WebhookValidator {\n  constructor() {\n    this.allowedFields = new Set([\n      'id', 'title', 'description', 'url', 'timestamp', \n      'category', 'priority', 'source', 'data'\n    ]);\n    this.maxPayloadSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB\n  }\n\n  validatePayload(payload) {\n    if (!payload || typeof payload !== 'object') {\n      throw new Error('Invalid payload: must be object');\n    }\n\n    const payloadStr = JSON.stringify(payload);\n    if (payloadStr.length > this.maxPayloadSize) {\n      throw new Error('Payload too large');\n    }\n\n    return this.sanitizePayload(payload);\n  }\n\n  sanitizePayload(payload) {\n    const sanitized = {};\n    \n    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(payload)) {\n      if (this.allowedFields.has(key)) {\n        sanitized[key] = this.sanitizeValue(value);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return sanitized;\n  }\n\n  sanitizeValue(value) {\n    if (typeof value === 'string') {\n      // Remove potentially dangerous content\n      return value.replace(/<script\\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\\/script>/gi, '')\n                  .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')\n                  .trim();\n    }\n    \n    if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {\n      return this.sanitizePayload(value);\n    }\n\n    return value;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst validator = new WebhookValidator();\n\nasync function secureWebhookHandler(rawPayload) {\n  try {\n    const cleanPayload = validator.validatePayload(rawPayload);\n    \n    // Send to Huginn\n    await sendWebhook(cleanPayload);\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Validation failed:', error.message);\n    // Log security incident\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive integration guide covers the major patterns and best practices for working with the Huginn API.

[Security Best Practices](#security-best-practices)\n\n## Authentication Setup\n\n### Session-Based Authentication\n\nMost API operations require authentication. The simplest approach is to use session cookies:\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript example using fetch\nconst login = async (email, password) => {\n  const response = await fetch('/users/sign_in', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'X-CSRF-Token': getCSRFToken(),\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      user: { email, password }\n    }),\n    credentials: 'include' // Include cookies\n  });\n  \n  if (response.ok) {\n    console.log('Logged in successfully');\n  }\n};\n\n// Use authenticated session for subsequent requests\nconst getAgents = async () => {\n  const response = await fetch('/agents', {\n    credentials: 'include'\n  });\n  return response.json();\n};\n```\n\n### Webhook Authentication (No Session Required)\n\nWebhooks use secret-based authentication:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef send_webhook(user_id, agent_id, secret, data):\n    \"\"\"Send data to a Huginn webhook agent\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://your-huginn.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n    \n    response = requests.post(\n        url,\n        json=data,\n        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    )\n    \n    if response.status_code == 201:\n        print(\"Webhook sent successfully\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Webhook failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n    \n    return response\n\n# Example usage\nwebhook_data = {\n    \"event_type\": \"user_registration\",\n    \"user\": {\n        \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\"\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\n}\n\nsend_webhook(1, 123, \"your-secret-token\", webhook_data)\n```\n\n## Webhook Integration Patterns\n\n### 1. Basic Webhook Receiver\n\nCreate a WebhookAgent to receive external data:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/agents \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"GitHub Webhook Receiver\",\n    \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"secret\": \"github-webhook-secret\",\n      \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n      \"payload_path\": \".\",\n      \"verbs\": \"post\",\n      \"response\": \"Webhook received\",\n      \"code\": \"200\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### 2. Multi-Source Data Collector\n\nCollect data from multiple sources using different secrets:\n\n```javascript\nclass HuginnWebhookCollector {\n  constructor(baseUrl, userId, agentId) {\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n    this.userId = userId;\n    this.agentId = agentId;\n  }\n\n  async sendData(source, secret, data) {\n    const url = `${this.baseUrl}/users/${this.userId}/web_requests/${this.agentId}/${secret}`;\n    \n    const payload = {\n      source: source,\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n      data: data\n    };\n\n    const response = await fetch(url, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(payload)\n    });\n\n    return response.ok;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst collector = new HuginnWebhookCollector('https://your-huginn.com', 1, 123);\n\n// Collect from different sources\nawait collector.sendData('shopify', 'shopify-secret', { order_id: 12345 });\nawait collector.sendData('stripe', 'stripe-secret', { payment_id: 67890 });\nawait collector.sendData('mailchimp', 'mailchimp-secret', { subscriber: 'user@example.com' });\n```\n\n### 3. Webhook with reCAPTCHA Verification\n\nFor public-facing webhooks, add reCAPTCHA protection:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Contact Form Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"contact-form-secret\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 7,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret-key\",\n    \"score_threshold\": 0.5,\n    \"response\": \"Message received, thank you!\",\n    \"response_headers\": {\n      \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Agent Management\n\n### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation\n\nCreate agents programmatically based on configuration:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nclass HuginnAgentManager:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, session_cookie):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        self.headers = {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            'Cookie': f'_huginn_session={session_cookie}'\n        }\n    \n    def create_webhook_agent(self, name, secret, payload_path=\".\", verbs=\"post\"):\n        \"\"\"Create a new webhook agent\"\"\"\n        agent_data = {\n            \"name\": name,\n            \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"secret\": secret,\n                \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n                \"payload_path\": payload_path,\n                \"verbs\": verbs,\n                \"response\": \"Event created\"\n            }\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.post(\n            f\"{self.base_url}/agents\",\n            headers=self.headers,\n            json=agent_data\n        )\n        \n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            agent = response.json()\n            print(f\"Created agent: {agent['name']} (ID: {agent['id']})\")\n            return agent\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to create agent: {response.text}\")\n            return None\n    \n    def create_data_output_agent(self, name, secrets, template):\n        \"\"\"Create a new data output agent for RSS/JSON feeds\"\"\"\n        agent_data = {\n            \"name\": name,\n            \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"secrets\": secrets,\n                \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n                \"template\": template,\n                \"events_to_show\": 20\n            }\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.post(\n            f\"{self.base_url}/agents\",\n            headers=self.headers,\n            json=agent_data\n        )\n        \n        return response.json() if response.ok else None\n\n# Usage example\nmanager = HuginnAgentManager('https://your-huginn.com', 'your-session-cookie')\n\n# Create webhook receiver\nwebhook_agent = manager.create_webhook_agent(\n    \"API Data Receiver\",\n    \"api-data-secret\"\n)\n\n# Create RSS feed generator\nrss_template = {\n    \"title\": \"My Data Feed\",\n    \"description\": \"Real-time data updates\",\n    \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n        \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n        \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n        \"pubDate\": \"{{timestamp}}\"\n    }\n}\n\nrss_agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n    \"Data RSS Feed\",\n    [\"rss-feed-secret\"],\n    rss_template\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Agent Configuration Management\n\nUpdate agent configurations dynamically:\n\n```javascript\nclass AgentConfigManager {\n  constructor(baseUrl, sessionCookie) {\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n    this.headers = {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Cookie': `_huginn_session=${sessionCookie}`\n    };\n  }\n\n  async updateAgentOptions(agentId, newOptions) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/agents/${agentId}`, {\n      method: 'PUT',\n      headers: this.headers,\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        options: newOptions\n      })\n    });\n\n    return response.ok;\n  }\n\n  async enableAgent(agentId) {\n    return this.updateAgentOptions(agentId, { disabled: false });\n  }\n\n  async disableAgent(agentId) {\n    return this.updateAgentOptions(agentId, { disabled: true });\n  }\n\n  async runAgent(agentId) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/agents/${agentId}/run`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: this.headers\n    });\n    \n    return response.ok;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Data Processing Pipelines\n\n### 1. Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline\n\nCreate a pipeline where each agent processes data and passes it to the next:\n\n```python\ndef create_processing_pipeline(manager):\n    \"\"\"Create a multi-stage data processing pipeline\"\"\"\n    \n    # Stage 1: Data Ingestion\n    ingestion_agent = manager.create_webhook_agent(\n        \"Data Ingestion\",\n        \"ingestion-secret\",\n        \".\",  # Take full payload\n        \"post\"\n    )\n    \n    # Stage 2: Data Transformation (would be a custom agent)\n    # Stage 3: Data Output\n    output_template = {\n        \"title\": \"Processed Data Feed\",\n        \"description\": \"Transformed data from pipeline\",\n        \"item\": {\n            \"title\": \"{{processed_title}}\",\n            \"description\": \"{{summary}}\",\n            \"category\": \"{{category}}\",\n            \"pubDate\": \"{{processing_date}}\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    output_agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n        \"Pipeline Output\",\n        [\"pipeline-output-secret\"],\n        output_template\n    )\n    \n    return ingestion_agent, output_agent\n\n# Connect agents in pipeline (would require additional agent configuration)\n```\n\n### 2. Event Filtering and Routing\n\n```javascript\n// Monitor events and route based on content\nclass EventRouter {\n  constructor(huginnApi) {\n    this.api = huginnApi;\n  }\n\n  async routeEvents(sourceAgentId) {\n    const events = await this.api.getAgentEvents(sourceAgentId);\n    \n    for (const event of events) {\n      const category = this.categorizeEvent(event.payload);\n      await this.routeToCategory(event, category);\n    }\n  }\n\n  categorizeEvent(payload) {\n    // Custom logic to categorize events\n    if (payload.priority === 'high') return 'alerts';\n    if (payload.type === 'user_action') return 'analytics';\n    return 'general';\n  }\n\n  async routeToCategory(event, category) {\n    const webhookUrl = this.getCategoryWebhook(category);\n    // Send to appropriate webhook endpoint\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## RSS/JSON Feed Integration\n\n### 1. Creating Dynamic RSS Feeds\n\n```python\ndef create_news_aggregator_feed(manager):\n    \"\"\"Create an RSS feed that aggregates news from multiple sources\"\"\"\n    \n    template = {\n        \"title\": \"My News Aggregator\",\n        \"description\": \"Curated news from multiple sources\",\n        \"link\": \"https://your-domain.com\",\n        \"item\": {\n            \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n            \"description\": \"{{summary | truncate: 200}}\",\n            \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n            \"category\": \"{{source}}\",\n            \"author\": \"{{author}}\",\n            \"pubDate\": \"{{published_date}}\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    agent = manager.create_data_output_agent(\n        \"News Aggregator Feed\",\n        [\"news-feed-public\", \"news-feed-private\"],\n        template\n    )\n    \n    return agent\n\n# Access the feed\n# Public RSS: https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/news-feed-public.xml\n# Private JSON: https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/news-feed-private.json\n```\n\n### 2. Consuming Huginn Feeds\n\n```javascript\nclass HuginnFeedConsumer {\n  constructor(feedUrl) {\n    this.feedUrl = feedUrl;\n  }\n\n  async getRSSFeed() {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.feedUrl}.xml`);\n    const rssXml = await response.text();\n    \n    // Parse RSS XML (using a library like 'fast-xml-parser')\n    return this.parseRSS(rssXml);\n  }\n\n  async getJSONFeed() {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.feedUrl}.json`);\n    return response.json();\n  }\n\n  async getLatestItems(count = 10) {\n    const feed = await this.getJSONFeed();\n    return feed.items.slice(0, count);\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst consumer = new HuginnFeedConsumer(\n  'https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/456/your-secret'\n);\n\nconst latestNews = await consumer.getLatestItems(5);\nconsole.log('Latest news items:', latestNews);\n```\n\n## Event Monitoring\n\n### 1. Real-time Event Monitoring\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport requests\n\nclass HuginnEventMonitor:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, session_cookie):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        self.headers = {'Cookie': f'_huginn_session={session_cookie}'}\n        self.last_event_id = 0\n    \n    def monitor_events(self, agent_ids=None, callback=None):\n        \"\"\"Monitor events in real-time\"\"\"\n        while True:\n            try:\n                events = self.get_new_events(agent_ids)\n                \n                for event in events:\n                    if callback:\n                        callback(event)\n                    else:\n                        self.handle_event(event)\n                    \n                    self.last_event_id = max(self.last_event_id, event['id'])\n                \n                time.sleep(5)  # Poll every 5 seconds\n                \n            except KeyboardInterrupt:\n                print(\"Stopping monitor...\")\n                break\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Monitor error: {e}\")\n                time.sleep(30)  # Wait before retrying\n    \n    def get_new_events(self, agent_ids=None):\n        \"\"\"Get events newer than last_event_id\"\"\"\n        params = {}\n        if agent_ids:\n            params['agent_id'] = agent_ids[0]  # API limitation\n        \n        response = requests.get(\n            f\"{self.base_url}/events\",\n            headers=self.headers,\n            params=params\n        )\n        \n        if response.ok:\n            events = response.json()\n            return [e for e in events if e['id'] > self.last_event_id]\n        else:\n            return []\n    \n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        \"\"\"Default event handler\"\"\"\n        print(f\"Event {event['id']}: {event['payload']}\")\n\n# Usage\nmonitor = HuginnEventMonitor('https://your-huginn.com', 'your-session')\n\ndef custom_handler(event):\n    if event['payload'].get('priority') == 'high':\n        print(f\"HIGH PRIORITY: {event['payload']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Normal event: {event['id']}\")\n\nmonitor.monitor_events(callback=custom_handler)\n```\n\n### 2. Event Analytics\n\n```javascript\nclass EventAnalytics {\n  constructor(huginnApi) {\n    this.api = huginnApi;\n  }\n\n  async getEventStats(days = 7) {\n    const cutoff = new Date();\n    cutoff.setDate(cutoff.getDate() - days);\n    \n    const events = await this.api.getAllEvents();\n    const recentEvents = events.filter(e => \n      new Date(e.created_at) > cutoff\n    );\n\n    return {\n      total: recentEvents.length,\n      byAgent: this.groupByAgent(recentEvents),\n      byDay: this.groupByDay(recentEvents),\n      averagePerDay: recentEvents.length / days\n    };\n  }\n\n  groupByAgent(events) {\n    return events.reduce((acc, event) => {\n      acc[event.agent_id] = (acc[event.agent_id] || 0) + 1;\n      return acc;\n    }, {});\n  }\n\n  groupByDay(events) {\n    return events.reduce((acc, event) => {\n      const day = new Date(event.created_at).toISOString().split('T')[0];\n      acc[day] = (acc[day] || 0) + 1;\n      return acc;\n    }, {});\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling Strategies\n\n### 1. Robust Webhook Sender\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom urllib3.util.retry import Retry\n\nclass RobustWebhookSender:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, max_retries=3):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        self.session = requests.Session()\n        \n        # Configure retry strategy\n        retry_strategy = Retry(\n            total=max_retries,\n            backoff_factor=1,\n            status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],\n        )\n        \n        adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)\n        self.session.mount(\"http://\", adapter)\n        self.session.mount(\"https://\", adapter)\n    \n    def send_webhook(self, user_id, agent_id, secret, data, timeout=30):\n        \"\"\"Send webhook with comprehensive error handling\"\"\"\n        url = f\"{self.base_url}/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n        \n        try:\n            response = self.session.post(\n                url,\n                json=data,\n                timeout=timeout,\n                headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n            )\n            \n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return {'success': True, 'response': response.text}\n            \n        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:\n            return {'success': False, 'error': 'Request timeout'}\n        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:\n            return {'success': False, 'error': 'Connection error'}\n        except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n            return {\n                'success': False, \n                'error': f'HTTP error: {e.response.status_code}',\n                'details': e.response.text\n            }\n        except Exception as e:\n            return {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}\n\n# Usage with error handling\nsender = RobustWebhookSender('https://your-huginn.com')\n\nresult = sender.send_webhook(1, 123, \"secret\", {\"test\": \"data\"})\n\nif result['success']:\n    print(\"Webhook sent successfully\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Webhook failed: {result['error']}\")\n    # Log to monitoring system, queue for retry, etc.\n```\n\n### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern\n\n```javascript\nclass CircuitBreaker {\n  constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {\n    this.threshold = threshold;\n    this.timeout = timeout;\n    this.failureCount = 0;\n    this.state = 'CLOSED';\n    this.lastFailureTime = null;\n  }\n\n  async execute(operation) {\n    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {\n      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > this.timeout) {\n        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';\n      } else {\n        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');\n      }\n    }\n\n    try {\n      const result = await operation();\n      \n      if (this.state === 'HALF_OPEN') {\n        this.reset();\n      }\n      \n      return result;\n    } catch (error) {\n      this.recordFailure();\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  recordFailure() {\n    this.failureCount++;\n    this.lastFailureTime = Date.now();\n    \n    if (this.failureCount >= this.threshold) {\n      this.state = 'OPEN';\n    }\n  }\n\n  reset() {\n    this.failureCount = 0;\n    this.state = 'CLOSED';\n    this.lastFailureTime = null;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(3, 30000);\n\nasync function sendWebhookWithCircuitBreaker(data) {\n  try {\n    return await circuitBreaker.execute(() =>\n      fetch('/webhook-endpoint', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: JSON.stringify(data)\n      })\n    );\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Webhook failed:', error.message);\n    // Handle gracefully - store for later retry, use fallback, etc.\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\n### 1. Secure Secret Management\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport secrets\nimport hashlib\n\nclass SecureSecretManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.secrets_file = os.getenv('HUGINN_SECRETS_FILE', 'secrets.env')\n    \n    def generate_secret(self, length=32):\n        \"\"\"Generate a cryptographically secure secret\"\"\"\n        return secrets.token_urlsafe(length)\n    \n    def hash_secret(self, secret):\n        \"\"\"Hash a secret for storage comparison\"\"\"\n        return hashlib.sha256(secret.encode()).hexdigest()\n    \n    def validate_webhook_signature(self, payload, signature, secret):\n        \"\"\"Validate webhook signature (if implementing HMAC)\"\"\"\n        expected = hashlib.sha256(\n            (payload + secret).encode()\n        ).hexdigest()\n        return signature == expected\n\n# Environment variable management\ndef get_agent_secret(agent_name):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve agent secret from environment variables\"\"\"\n    return os.getenv(f'HUGINN_SECRET_{agent_name.upper()}')\n\ndef create_secure_webhook_agent(manager, name):\n    \"\"\"Create webhook agent with secure secret\"\"\"\n    secret_manager = SecureSecretManager()\n    secret = secret_manager.generate_secret()\n    \n    # Store secret securely (not in code!)\n    os.environ[f'HUGINN_SECRET_{name.upper()}'] = secret\n    \n    return manager.create_webhook_agent(name, secret)\n```\n\n### 2. Request Validation and Sanitization\n\n```javascript\nclass WebhookValidator {\n  constructor() {\n    this.allowedFields = new Set([\n      'id', 'title', 'description', 'url', 'timestamp', \n      'category', 'priority', 'source', 'data'\n    ]);\n    this.maxPayloadSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB\n  }\n\n  validatePayload(payload) {\n    if (!payload || typeof payload !== 'object') {\n      throw new Error('Invalid payload: must be object');\n    }\n\n    const payloadStr = JSON.stringify(payload);\n    if (payloadStr.length > this.maxPayloadSize) {\n      throw new Error('Payload too large');\n    }\n\n    return this.sanitizePayload(payload);\n  }\n\n  sanitizePayload(payload) {\n    const sanitized = {};\n    \n    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(payload)) {\n      if (this.allowedFields.has(key)) {\n        sanitized[key] = this.sanitizeValue(value);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return sanitized;\n  }\n\n  sanitizeValue(value) {\n    if (typeof value === 'string') {\n      // Remove potentially dangerous content\n      return value.replace(/<script\\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\\/script>/gi, '')\n                  .replace(/javascript:/gi, '')\n                  .trim();\n    }\n    \n    if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {\n      return this.sanitizePayload(value);\n    }\n\n    return value;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst validator = new WebhookValidator();\n\nasync function secureWebhookHandler(rawPayload) {\n  try {\n    const cleanPayload = validator.validatePayload(rawPayload);\n    \n    // Send to Huginn\n    await sendWebhook(cleanPayload);\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Validation failed:', error.message);\n    // Log security incident\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive integration guide covers the major patterns and best practices for working with the Huginn API.

['Secret must be at least 8 characters'] : []),\n      ...((secret && !/^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]+$/.test(secret)) ? ['Secret can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores'] : [])\n    ]\n  };\n}\n\n// Environment-based configuration\nconst CONFIG = {\n  baseURL: process.env.HUGINN_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',\n  webhookSecrets: {\n    github: process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n    slack: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n    generic: process.env.GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting and Monitoring\n\n```javascript\n// Rate limiting helper\nclass RateLimiter {\n  constructor(maxRequests = 100, windowMs = 60000) {\n    this.maxRequests = maxRequests;\n    this.windowMs = windowMs;\n    this.requests = [];\n  }\n  \n  canMakeRequest() {\n    const now = Date.now();\n    this.requests = this.requests.filter(time => now - time < this.windowMs);\n    \n    if (this.requests.length >= this.maxRequests) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    \n    this.requests.push(now);\n    return true;\n  }\n  \n  async waitForSlot() {\n    while (!this.canMakeRequest()) {\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in API client\nconst rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(50, 60000); // 50 requests per minute\n\nasync function makeRateLimitedRequest(url, options) {\n  await rateLimiter.waitForSlot();\n  return await fetch(url, options);\n}\n```\n\nThis examples guide provides practical patterns for integrating with Huginn's API across different use cases and programming languages.

['Secret can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores'] : [])\n    ]\n  };\n}\n\n// Environment-based configuration\nconst CONFIG = {\n  baseURL: process.env.HUGINN_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',\n  webhookSecrets: {\n    github: process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n    slack: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n    generic: process.env.GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting and Monitoring\n\n```javascript\n// Rate limiting helper\nclass RateLimiter {\n  constructor(maxRequests = 100, windowMs = 60000) {\n    this.maxRequests = maxRequests;\n    this.windowMs = windowMs;\n    this.requests = [];\n  }\n  \n  canMakeRequest() {\n    const now = Date.now();\n    this.requests = this.requests.filter(time => now - time < this.windowMs);\n    \n    if (this.requests.length >= this.maxRequests) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    \n    this.requests.push(now);\n    return true;\n  }\n  \n  async waitForSlot() {\n    while (!this.canMakeRequest()) {\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in API client\nconst rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(50, 60000); // 50 requests per minute\n\nasync function makeRateLimitedRequest(url, options) {\n  await rateLimiter.waitForSlot();\n  return await fetch(url, options);\n}\n```\n\nThis examples guide provides practical patterns for integrating with Huginn's API across different use cases and programming languages.

Set Up Authentication\n```javascript\n// Login to get session\nconst response = await fetch('/users/sign_in', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: new FormData(loginForm),\n  credentials: 'include'\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Create Your First Agent\n```javascript\n// Create a webhook receiver\nconst agent = await fetch('/agents', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n  credentials: 'include',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    agent: {\n      name: \"My First Webhook\",\n      type: \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n      options: {\n        secret: \"my-secret-123\",\n        payload_path: \".\"\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Send Data to Your Agent\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:3000/users/1/web_requests/1/my-secret-123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello Huginn!\"}'\n```\n\n### 4. View Generated Events\n```javascript\nconst events = await fetch('/agents/1/events.json', {\n  credentials: 'include'\n});\n```\n\n## API Conventions\n\n### Request/Response Format\n- **Content Type:** `application/json` for most requests\n- **Authentication:** Session cookies for web APIs, secret tokens for webhooks\n- **Pagination:** Use `page` parameter where supported\n- **Sorting:** Varies by endpoint, see specific documentation\n\n### Response Codes\n- `200` - Success\n- `201` - Created\n- `401` - Unauthorized (login required)\n- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions or invalid secret)\n- `404` - Not Found\n- `422` - Validation Error\n- `423` - Locked (resource temporarily unavailable)\n\n### Error Format\n```json\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    \"field_name\": [\"error message\"],\n    \"base\": [\"general error\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 🔒 **Security**\n- Use strong, unique secrets for webhook endpoints\n- Regularly rotate secret tokens\n- Validate webhook payloads to prevent abuse\n- Use HTTPS in production environments\n\n### ⚡ **Performance**  \n- Implement client-side rate limiting\n- Cache agent configurations when possible\n- Use pagination for large result sets\n- Monitor system status via worker status endpoint\n\n### 🛡️ **Reliability**\n- Implement proper error handling and retries\n- Validate agent configurations before creation\n- Monitor agent health and event generation\n- Use scenarios to organize complex workflows\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- **API Issues?** Check the error response format and status codes\n- **Agent Configuration?** See agent-specific documentation in the examples\n- **Integration Problems?** Review the authentication and webhook setup examples\n- **Performance Questions?** Consult the worker status monitoring section\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound an error in the documentation or want to add examples? Contributions are welcome!\n\n1. Check existing documentation for accuracy\n2. Add new examples following established patterns\n3. Update relevant sections when adding new features\n4. Test all code examples before submitting\n\n---\n\nFor the most up-to-date API information, always refer to the running Huginn instance's actual endpoint responses and the source code in `app/controllers/` and `app/models/`."

    "content": "# Webhook Integration Examples\n\nThis document provides practical examples for integrating webhooks with Huginn agents.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Basic Webhook Setup](#basic-webhook-setup)\n2. [E-commerce Integration](#e-commerce-integration)\n3. [GitHub Integration](#github-integration)\n4. [Monitoring and Alerting](#monitoring-and-alerting)\n5. [Social Media Integration](#social-media-integration)\n6. [IoT Device Integration](#iot-device-integration)\n\n## Basic Webhook Setup\n\n### Creating a Simple WebhookAgent\n\nFirst, create a WebhookAgent through the API:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/agents \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"Basic Webhook Receiver\",\n    \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"secret\": \"my-unique-secret-123\",\n      \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n      \"payload_path\": \".\",\n      \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n      \"response\": \"Received successfully\",\n      \"code\": \"200\",\n      \"response_headers\": {\n        \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### Sending Data to the Webhook\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef send_to_huginn(data, user_id=1, agent_id=123, secret=\"my-unique-secret-123\"):\n    \"\"\"Send data to Huginn webhook\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://your-huginn.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n    \n    payload = {\n        \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n        \"data\": data\n    }\n    \n    response = requests.post(\n        url,\n        json=payload,\n        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n    print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n    \n    return response.ok\n\n# Example usage\nsend_to_huginn({\"event\": \"test\", \"value\": 42})\n```\n\n## E-commerce Integration\n\n### Shopify Order Webhook\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Shopify Order Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"shopify-orders-webhook-secret\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"verbs\": \"post\",\n    \"response\": \"Order processed\",\n    \"event_headers\": \"X-Shopify-Topic,X-Shopify-Shop-Domain,X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256\",\n    \"event_headers_key\": \"shopify_headers\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConfigure Shopify to send orders to:\n```\nhttps://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/shopify-orders-webhook-secret\n```\n\n### Processing Shopify Order Data\n\n```javascript\n// Shopify webhook payload processing\nfunction processShopifyOrder(webhookPayload) {\n    const order = webhookPayload;\n    \n    const processedData = {\n        order_id: order.id,\n        customer_email: order.email,\n        customer_name: `${order.billing_address.first_name} ${order.billing_address.last_name}`,\n        total_price: order.total_price,\n        currency: order.currency,\n        line_items: order.line_items.map(item => ({\n            name: item.name,\n            quantity: item.quantity,\n            price: item.price\n        })),\n        created_at: order.created_at,\n        order_status: order.financial_status\n    };\n    \n    // Send to Huginn for further processing\n    sendToHuginn(processedData);\n    \n    return processedData;\n}\n```\n\n### Stripe Payment Webhook\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Stripe Payment Webhook\",\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\", \n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"stripe-payment-webhook-secret\",\n

\"base_branch\": pr['base']['ref'],\n        \"head_branch\": pr['head']['ref']\n    }\n```\n\n### Configure GitHub Webhook\n\nSet your webhook URL in GitHub repository settings:\n```\nPayload URL: https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/github-repo-webhook-secret\nContent type: application/json\nEvents: Push, Pull requests, Issues\n```\n\n## Monitoring and Alerting\n\n### Server Health

    "content": "# Webhook Integration Examples\n\nThis document provides practical examples for integrating webhooks with Huginn agents.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Basic Webhook Setup](#basic-webhook-setup)\n2. [E-commerce Integration](#e-commerce-integration)\n3. [GitHub Integration](#github-integration)\n4. [Monitoring and Alerting](#monitoring-and-alerting)\n5. [Social Media Integration](#social-media-integration)\n6. [IoT Device Integration](#iot-device-integration)\n\n## Basic Webhook Setup\n\n### Creating a Simple WebhookAgent\n\nFirst, create a WebhookAgent through the API:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/agents \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"Basic Webhook Receiver\",\n    \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"secret\": \"my-unique-secret-123\",\n      \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n      \"payload_path\": \".\",\n      \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n      \"response\": \"Received successfully\",\n      \"code\": \"200\",\n      \"response_headers\": {\n        \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n### Sending Data to the Webhook\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef send_to_huginn(data, user_id=1, agent_id=123, secret=\"my-unique-secret-123\"):\n    \"\"\"Send data to Huginn webhook\"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://your-huginn.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n    \n    payload = {\n        \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n        \"data\": data\n    }\n    \n    response = requests.post(\n        url,\n        json=payload,\n        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n    print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n    \n    return response.ok\n\n# Example usage\nsend_to_huginn({\"event\": \"test\", \"value\":

    "content": "# Huginn API Integration Guide\n\nHuginn provides powerful APIs for integrating external systems through webhooks, data feeds, and agent management. This guide covers all aspects of API integration with practical examples and best practices.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n2. [Authentication & Security](#authentication--security)\n3. [Webhook Integration (Sending Data TO Huginn)](#webhook-integration-sending-data-to-huginn)\n4. [Data Retrieval (Getting Data FROM Huginn)](#data-retrieval-getting-data-from-huginn)\n5. [Agent Management API](#agent-management-api)\n6. [Worker Status & Monitoring](#worker-status--monitoring)\n7. [Integration Examples](#integration-examples)\n8. [Error Handling & Best Practices](#error-handling--best-practices)\n9. [Rate Limiting & Performance](#rate-limiting--performance)\n10. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Base Configuration\n\nAll Huginn API endpoints follow these patterns:\n\n**Webhook Endpoints (Incoming Data):**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n**Data Output Endpoints (Outgoing Data):**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}\n```\n\n### Required Information\n\nTo integrate with Huginn APIs, you need:\n\n- **Domain**: Your Huginn instance URL\n- **User ID**: Found in your account settings or agent URLs\n- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for each agent (visible in agent URLs)\n- **Secret**: Authentication token configured in the agent\n\n### Common Headers\n\n```http\nContent-Type: application/json\nUser-Agent: YourApp/1.0\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n### Secret-Based Authentication\n\nHuginn uses secret tokens for API authentication. Each agent that accepts web requests has configurable secrets.\n\n#### Security Best Practices:\n\n1. **Use Strong Secrets**: Generate cryptographically secure tokens\n2. **Rotate Regularly**: Change secrets periodically\n3. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables, not code\n4. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production\n5. **Restrict Access**: Use firewalls and IP whitelisting when possible\n\n#### Example Secret Configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1\n}\n```\n\n## Webhook Integration (Sending Data TO Huginn)\n\nWebhookAgent receives external data via HTTP requests and creates Huginn events.\n\n### Basic Webhook Setup\n\n#### 1. Create a WebhookAgent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"name\": \"External Data Webhook\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"your-secure-secret-here\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"verbs\": \"post\",\n    \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n    \"code\": \"201\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Webhook URL Format\n\n```\nPOST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secure-secret-here\n```\n\n### Webhook Configuration Options\n\n| Option | Description | Default | Example |\n|--------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| `secret` | Authentication token | Generated UUID | `\"abc123xyz\"` |\n| `verbs` | Allowed HTTP methods | `\"post\"` | `\"post,get,put\"` |\n| `payload_path` | JSONPath to extract data | `\".\"` | `\"$.data.items\"` |\n| `response` | Success response message | `\"Event Created\"` | `\"Data received\"` |\n| `code` | HTTP response code | `201` | `200` |\n| `event_headers` | Headers to include | `\"\"` | `\"X-Source,Authorization\"` |\n\n### Advanced Webhook Features\n\n#### Custom Response Headers\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"X-API-Version\": \"1.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Array Processing\nWhen `payload_path` points to an array, Huginn creates one event per array element:\n\n```json\n// Incoming data\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Item 1\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Item 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n// Configuration\n{\n  \"payload_path\": \"$.items\"\n}\n// Results in 2 separate events\n```\n\n#### reCAPTCHA Integration\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5\n}\n```\n\n### Webhook Integration Examples\n\n#### JavaScript/Node.js\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nconst webhookUrl = 'https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123';\n\nasync function sendToHuginn(data) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.post(webhookUrl, data, {\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0'\n      },\n      timeout: 10000\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Success:', response.status, response.data);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to send webhook:', {\n      status: error.response?.status,\n      data: error.response?.data,\n      message: error.message\n    });\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nawait sendToHuginn({\n  event_type: 'user_action',\n  user_id: 12345,\n  action: 'purchase',\n  amount: 99.99,\n  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n});\n```\n\n#### Python\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef send_to_huginn(webhook_url, data, timeout=10):\n    \"\"\"Send data to Huginn webhook with error handling\"\"\"\n    \n    headers = {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0'\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.post(\n            webhook_url,\n            data=json.dumps(data),\n            headers=headers,\n            timeout=timeout\n        )\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        \n        print(f\"Success: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n        return response.json() if response.content else None\n        \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Webhook failed: {e}\")\n        if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response:\n            print(f\"Response: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}\")\n        raise\n\n# Usage\nwebhook_url = \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\"\ndata = {\n    \"sensor_id\": \"temp_01\",\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat()\n}\n\nsend_to_huginn(webhook_url, data)\n```\n\n#### cURL Examples\n```bash\n# Simple POST\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello from external system\"}'\n\n# With custom headers\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"X-Source-System: monitoring\" \\\n  -H \"X-Priority: high\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"alert\": \"CPU usage critical\",\n    \"server\": \"web-01\",\n    \"cpu_usage\": 95.5,\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n  }'\n\n# GET request (if enabled)\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123?status=check&source=external\"\n```\n\n## Data Retrieval (Getting Data FROM Huginn)\n\nDataOutputAgent provides RSS and JSON feeds of Huginn event data.\n\n### Basic Data Output Setup\n\n#### 1. Create a DataOutputAgent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"name\": \"API Data Feed\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"feed-secret-123\", \"backup-secret-456\"],\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n    \"events_to_show\": 50,\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"My Huginn Data Feed\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time data from Huginn agents\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{title | default: 'Event'}}\",\n        \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n        \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n        \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.

Polling Strategies\n\n#### Polling Best Practices\n1. **Reasonable Intervals**: Don't poll more than once every 15-30 seconds\n2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increase intervals on errors\n3. **Conditional Requests**: Use ETags or timestamps when possible\n4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle timeouts and failures gracefully\n\n#### Webhook Alternative\nInstead of polling DataOutputAgent, consider using WebhookAgent in reverse:\n1. Configure DataOutputAgent to trigger another agent\n2. Use PostAgent or similar to send data to your external system\n3. Implement webhook endpoint in your system to receive real-time data\n\n## Agent Management API\n\nWhile Huginn doesn't provide a full REST API for agent management, you can interact with agents programmatically through the web interface endpoints.\n\n### Available Endpoints\n\n#### Agent Listing\n```http\nGET /agents.json\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Agent Details  \n```http\nGET /agents/{agent_id}.json\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Agent Execution\n```http\nPOST /agents/{agent_id}/run\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Event Management\n```http\nGET /agents/{agent_id}/events.json\nPOST /agents/{agent_id}/reemit_events\nDELETE /agents/{agent_id}/remove_events\n```\n\n### Scenario Export/Import\n\n#### Export Scenario\n```http\nGET /scenarios/{scenario_id}/export\n# No authentication required for public scenarios\n```\n\nResponse includes complete scenario configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"schema_version\": 1,\n  \"name\": \"My Scenario\",\n  \"description\": \"Automated workflow\",\n  \"agents\": [...],\n  \"links\": [...],\n  \"control_links\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### Agent Configuration via API\n\nSince direct agent management requires authentication, consider these patterns:\n\n#### 1. Configuration Templates\nPre-create agent templates and use webhook data to modify behavior:\n\n```javascript\n// WebhookAgent that configures other agents based on incoming data\nconst configWebhook = {\n  type: \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  options: {\n    secret: \"config-secret\",\n    payload_path: \".\",\n    // Process configuration updates\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Agent Behavior\nUse memory and options interpolation for dynamic behavior:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"{{credential.api_base_url}}/{{memory.current_endpoint}}\",\n

Practices\n\n### Common HTTP Status Codes\n\n| Code | Meaning | Cause | Solution |\n|------|---------|-------|---------|\n| `200` | Success | Request processed | Continue normal operation |\n| `201` | Created | Webhook event created | Continue normal operation |\n| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid payload format | Check JSON syntax and required fields |\n| `401` | Unauthorized | Wrong secret | Verify secret token |\n| `404` | Not Found | Invalid agent/user ID | Check URL parameters |\n| `422` | Unprocessable | Validation failed | Review agent options and payload |\n| `500` | Server Error |

**Network Bandwidth**: Especially for data feeds\n\n### Client-Side Rate Limiting\n\n```javascript\nclass RateLimitedHuginnClient {\n  constructor(config) {\n    this.config = config;\n

Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues & Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" (401 Error)\n**Cause**: Incorrect secret token\n**Solutions**:\n- Verify the secret matches exactly (case-sensitive)\n- Check URL path parameters (user_id, agent_id, secret)\n- Ensure agent is configured to accept your HTTP method (verbs option)\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl to isolate the issue\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}'\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" (404 Error)\n**Cause**: Invalid agent ID or user ID\n**Solutions**:\n- Verify agent ID from Huginn web interface\n- Check that agent exists and belongs to the specified user\n- Ensure agent type supports web requests\n\n#### 3. Empty or No Response from Data Feed\n**Cause**: No events in agent or wrong URL format\n**Solutions**:\n- Check if source agents are creating events\n- Verify DataOutputAgent has received events\n- Test both .json and .xml endpoints\n- Check events_to_show configuration\n\n```javascript\n// Debug data feed issues\nasync function debugDataFeed(feedUrl) {\n  try {\n    // Test JSON endpoint\n    const jsonResponse = await fetch(feedUrl.replace('.xml', '.json'));\n    const jsonData = await jsonResponse.json();\n    \n    console.log('JSON feed status:', jsonResponse.status);\n    console.log('Items count:', jsonData.items?.length || 0);\n    \n    // Test XML endpoint\n    const xmlResponse = await fetch(feedUrl.replace('.json', '.xml'));\n    const xmlData = await xmlResponse.text();\n    \n    console.log('XML feed status:', xmlResponse.status);\n    console.log('XML length:', xmlData.length);\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Feed debug failed:', error.message);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Slow Response Times\n**Cause**: Large datasets or server load\n**Solutions**:\n- Reduce events_to_show in DataOutputAgent\n- Implement client-side caching\n- Use pagination if available\n- Check Huginn server resources\n\n#### 5. Webhook Timeouts\n**Cause**: Long processing time or server issues\n**Solutions**:\n- Increase client timeout values\n- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Check Huginn server logs\n- Reduce payload size\n\n### Debug Tools & Scripts\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass HuginnDebugger:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, user_id):\n        self.base_url = base_url.rstrip('/')\n        self.user_id = user_id\n\n    def test_webhook_agent(self, agent_id, secret, test_payload=None):\n        \"\"\"Test webhook agent connectivity and response\"\"\"\n        webhook_url = f\"{self.base_url}/users/{self.user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n        \n        if test_payload is None:\n            test_payload = {\n                \"test\": True,\n                \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n                \"debug_id\": f\"debug_{int(time.time())}\"\n            }\n        \n        print(f\"Testing webhook: {webhook_url}\")\n        print(f\"Payload: {json.dumps(test_payload, indent=2)}\")\n        \n        try:\n            start_time = time.time()\n            response = requests.post(\n                webhook_url,\n                json=test_payload,\n                headers={\n                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n                    'User-Agent': 'HuginnDebugger/1.0'\n                },\n                timeout=30\n            )\n            duration = time.time() - start_time\n            \n            print(f\"\\n✅ Success!\")\n            print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n            print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n            print(f\"Duration: {duration:.3f}s\")\n            print(f\"Headers: {dict(response.headers)}\")\n            \n            return True\n            \n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"\\n❌ Failed!\")\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n            if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response:\n                print(f\"Status: {e.response.status_code}\")\n                print(f\"Response: {e.response.text}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_data_output_agent(self, agent_id, secret):\n        \"\"\"Test data output agent feeds\"\"\"\n        base_url = f\"{self.base_url}/users/{self.user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n        \n        formats = ['json', 'xml']\n        results = {}\n        \n        for format_type in formats:\n            feed_url = f\"{base_url}.{format_type}\"\n            print(f\"\\nTesting {format_type.upper()} feed: {feed_url}\")\n            \n            try:\n                start_time = time.time()\n                response = requests.get(feed_url, timeout=30)\n                duration = time.time() - start_time\n                \n                if response.ok:\n                    if format_type == 'json':\n                        data = response.json()\n                        item_count = len(data.get('items', []))\n                        print(f\"✅ JSON feed working - {item_count} items\")\n                        results[format_type] = {'success': True, 'items': item_count}\n                    else:\n                        content_length = len(response.text)\n                        print(f\"✅ XML feed working - {content_length} characters\")\n                        results[format_type] = {'success': True, 'size': content_length}\n                    \n                    print(f\"Duration: {duration:.3f}s\")\n                else:\n                    print(f\"❌ {format_type.upper()} feed failed: {response.status_code}\")\n                    print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n                    results[format_type] = {'success': False, 'error': response.status_code}\n                    \n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"❌ {format_type.upper()} feed error: {e}\")\n                results[format_type] = {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}\n        \n        return results\n\n    def test_connectivity(self):\n        \"\"\"Test basic connectivity to Huginn instance\"\"\"\n        test_url = f\"{self.base_url}/about\"\n        \n        print(f\"Testing connectivity to: {self.base_url}\")\n        \n        try:\n            response = requests.get(test_url, timeout=10)\n            if response.ok:\n                print(\"✅ Huginn instance is reachable\")\n                return True\n            else:\n                print(f\"⚠️  Huginn responded with status: {response.status_code}\")\n                return False\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"❌ Cannot reach Huginn: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def run_full_diagnostic(self, agents_config):\n        \"\"\"Run complete diagnostic suite\"\"\"\n        print(\"🔍 Starting Huginn Integration Diagnostic\\n\")\n        print(\"=\" * 50)\n        \n        # Test connectivity\n        print(\"\\n1.

    "content": "# Huginn API Integration Guide\n\nHuginn provides powerful APIs for integrating external systems through webhooks, data feeds, and agent management. This guide covers all aspects of API integration with practical examples and best practices.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n2. [Authentication & Security](#authentication--security)\n3. [Webhook Integration (Sending Data TO Huginn)](#webhook-integration-sending-data-to-huginn)\n4.

[Rate Limiting & Performance](#rate-limiting--performance)\n10. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Base Configuration\n\nAll Huginn API endpoints follow these patterns:\n\n**Webhook Endpoints (Incoming Data):**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\n```\n\n**Data Output Endpoints (Outgoing Data):**\n```\nhttps://your-huginn-domain.com/users/{user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}.{format}\n```\n\n### Required Information\n\nTo integrate with Huginn APIs, you need:\n\n- **Domain**: Your Huginn instance URL\n- **User ID**: Found in your account settings or agent URLs\n- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for each agent (visible in agent URLs)\n- **Secret**: Authentication token configured in the agent\n\n### Common Headers\n\n```http\nContent-Type: application/json\nUser-Agent: YourApp/1.0\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n### Secret-Based Authentication\n\nHuginn uses secret tokens for API authentication. Each agent that accepts web requests has configurable secrets.\n\n#### Security Best Practices:\n\n1. **Use Strong Secrets**: Generate cryptographically secure tokens\n2. **Rotate Regularly**: Change secrets periodically\n3. **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables, not code\n4. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production\n5. **Restrict Access**: Use firewalls and IP whitelisting when possible\n\n#### Example Secret Configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"secret\": \"a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6\",\n  \"verbs\": \"post,get\",\n  \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1\n}\n```\n\n## Webhook Integration (Sending Data TO Huginn)\n\nWebhookAgent receives external data via HTTP requests and creates Huginn events.\n\n### Basic Webhook Setup\n\n#### 1. Create a WebhookAgent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  \"name\": \"External Data Webhook\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secret\": \"your-secure-secret-here\",\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 1,\n    \"payload_path\": \".\",\n    \"verbs\": \"post\",\n    \"response\": \"Event Created\",\n    \"code\": \"201\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Webhook URL Format\n\n```\nPOST https://your-huginn.com/users/123/web_requests/456/your-secure-secret-here\n```\n\n### Webhook Configuration Options\n\n| Option | Description | Default | Example |\n|--------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| `secret` | Authentication token | Generated UUID | `\"abc123xyz\"` |\n| `verbs` | Allowed HTTP methods | `\"post\"` | `\"post,get,put\"` |\n| `payload_path` | JSONPath to extract data | `\".\"` | `\"$.data.items\"` |\n| `response` | Success response message | `\"Event Created\"` | `\"Data received\"` |\n| `code` | HTTP response code | `201` | `200` |\n| `event_headers` | Headers to include | `\"\"` | `\"X-Source,Authorization\"` |\n\n### Advanced Webhook Features\n\n#### Custom Response Headers\n```json\n{\n  \"response_headers\": {\n    \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\",\n    \"X-API-Version\": \"1.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Array Processing\nWhen `payload_path` points to an array, Huginn creates one event per array element:\n\n```json\n// Incoming data\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Item 1\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Item 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n// Configuration\n{\n  \"payload_path\": \"$.items\"\n}\n// Results in 2 separate events\n```\n\n#### reCAPTCHA Integration\n```json\n{\n  \"recaptcha_secret\": \"your-recaptcha-secret\",\n  \"recaptcha_send_remote_addr\": true,\n  \"score_threshold\": 0.5\n}\n```\n\n### Webhook Integration Examples\n\n#### JavaScript/Node.js\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nconst webhookUrl = 'https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123';\n\nasync function sendToHuginn(data) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.post(webhookUrl, data, {\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0'\n      },\n      timeout: 10000\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Success:', response.status, response.data);\n    return response.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to send webhook:', {\n      status: error.response?.status,\n      data: error.response?.data,\n      message: error.message\n    });\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nawait sendToHuginn({\n  event_type: 'user_action',\n  user_id: 12345,\n  action: 'purchase',\n  amount: 99.99,\n  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n});\n```\n\n#### Python\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef send_to_huginn(webhook_url, data, timeout=10):\n    \"\"\"Send data to Huginn webhook with error handling\"\"\"\n    \n    headers = {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0'\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.post(\n            webhook_url,\n            data=json.dumps(data),\n            headers=headers,\n            timeout=timeout\n        )\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        \n        print(f\"Success: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n        return response.json() if response.content else None\n        \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Webhook failed: {e}\")\n        if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response:\n            print(f\"Response: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}\")\n        raise\n\n# Usage\nwebhook_url = \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\"\ndata = {\n    \"sensor_id\": \"temp_01\",\n    \"temperature\": 23.5,\n    \"humidity\": 65.2,\n    \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat()\n}\n\nsend_to_huginn(webhook_url, data)\n```\n\n#### cURL Examples\n```bash\n# Simple POST\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello from external system\"}'\n\n# With custom headers\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"X-Source-System: monitoring\" \\\n  -H \"X-Priority: high\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"alert\": \"CPU usage critical\",\n    \"server\": \"web-01\",\n    \"cpu_usage\": 95.5,\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n  }'\n\n# GET request (if enabled)\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/secret123?status=check&source=external\"\n```\n\n## Data Retrieval (Getting Data FROM Huginn)\n\nDataOutputAgent provides RSS and JSON feeds of Huginn event data.\n\n### Basic Data Output Setup\n\n#### 1. Create a DataOutputAgent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Agents::DataOutputAgent\",\n  \"name\": \"API Data Feed\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"secrets\": [\"feed-secret-123\", \"backup-secret-456\"],\n    \"expected_receive_period_in_days\": 2,\n    \"events_to_show\": 50,\n    \"template\": {\n      \"title\": \"My Huginn Data Feed\",\n      \"description\": \"Real-time data from Huginn agents\",\n      \"item\": {\n        \"title\": \"{{title | default: 'Event'}}\",\n        \"description\": \"{{description}}\",\n        \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n        \"pubDate\": \"{{created_at}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Data Feed URLs\n\n```\n# JSON format\nGET https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/789/feed-secret-123.json\n\n# RSS/XML format  \nGET https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/789/feed-secret-123.xml\n```\n\n### DataOutputAgent Configuration\n\n| Option | Description | Default | Example |\n|--------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| `secrets` | Array of valid auth tokens | Required | `[\"secret1\", \"secret2\"]` |\n| `events_to_show` | Number of events in feed | `40` | `100` |\n| `ttl` | RSS cache time (minutes) | `60` | `30` |\n| `events_order` | Event sorting criteria | Event creation time | `[[\"payload.priority\", \"number\", true]]` |\n| `template` | Output format template | Required | See examples below |\n\n### Template Configuration\n\n#### Basic Template\n```json\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"{{events.first.site_name | default: 'Data Feed'}}\",\n    \"description\": \"Latest events from Huginn\",\n    \"link\": \"https://example.com\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{title}}\",\n      \"description\": \"{{content}}\",\n      \"link\": \"{{url}}\",\n      \"guid\": \"{{id}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Advanced Template with Custom Fields\n```json\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"title\": \"IoT Sensor Data\",\n    \"description\": \"Real-time sensor readings\",\n    \"item\": {\n      \"title\": \"{{sensor_name}} - {{reading_type}}\",\n      \"description\": \"Value: {{value}} {{unit}} at {{timestamp}}\",\n      \"link\":

Polling Strategies\n\n#### Polling Best Practices\n1. **Reasonable Intervals**: Don't poll more than once every 15-30 seconds\n2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increase intervals on errors\n3. **Conditional Requests**: Use ETags or timestamps when possible\n4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle timeouts and failures gracefully\n\n#### Webhook Alternative\nInstead of polling DataOutputAgent, consider using WebhookAgent in reverse:\n1. Configure DataOutputAgent to trigger another agent\n2. Use PostAgent or similar to send data to your external system\n3. Implement webhook endpoint in your system to receive real-time data\n\n## Agent Management API\n\nWhile Huginn doesn't provide a full REST API for agent management, you can interact with agents programmatically through the web interface endpoints.\n\n### Available Endpoints\n\n#### Agent Listing\n```http\nGET /agents.json\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Agent Details  \n```http\nGET /agents/{agent_id}.json\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Agent Execution\n```http\nPOST /agents/{agent_id}/run\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\n#### Event Management\n```http\nGET /agents/{agent_id}/events.json\nPOST /agents/{agent_id}/reemit_events\nDELETE /agents/{agent_id}/remove_events\n```\n\n### Scenario Export/Import\n\n#### Export Scenario\n```http\nGET /scenarios/{scenario_id}/export\n# No authentication required for public scenarios\n```\n\nResponse includes complete scenario configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"schema_version\": 1,\n  \"name\": \"My Scenario\",\n  \"description\": \"Automated workflow\",\n  \"agents\": [...],\n  \"links\": [...],\n  \"control_links\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### Agent Configuration via API\n\nSince direct agent management requires authentication, consider these patterns:\n\n#### 1. Configuration Templates\nPre-create agent templates and use webhook data to modify behavior:\n\n```javascript\n// WebhookAgent that configures other agents based on incoming data\nconst configWebhook = {\n  type: \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n  options: {\n    secret: \"config-secret\",\n    payload_path: \".\",\n    // Process configuration updates\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Agent Behavior\nUse memory and options interpolation for dynamic behavior:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"{{credential.api_base_url}}/{{memory.current_endpoint}}\",\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Authorization\": \"Bearer {{credential.api_token}}\",\n      \"X-Source\": \"{{memory.data_source}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Worker Status & Monitoring\n\n### Worker Status Endpoint\n\n```http\nGET /worker_status\nAuthorization: [Session-based authentication required]\n```\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"pending\": 5,\n  \"awaiting_retry\": 2,\n  \"recent_failures\": 1,\n  \"event_count\": 150,\n  \"max_id\": 2847,\n  \"events_url\": \"/events?hl=2840-2847\",\n  \"compute_time\": 0.045\n}\n```\n\n### Health Check Integration\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nclass HuginnMonitor {\n  constructor(baseUrl, credentials) {\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n    this.credentials = credentials;\n  }\n\n  async getWorkerStatus() {\n    try {\n      const response = await axios.get(`${this.baseUrl}/worker_status`, {\n        // Add session-based authentication\n        timeout: 10000\n      });\n      \n      return response.data;\n    } catch (error) {\n      throw new Error(`Worker status check failed: ${error.message}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  async isHealthy() {\n    try {\n      const status = await this.getWorkerStatus();\n      \n      // Define health criteria\n      const maxPending = 100;\n      const maxFailures = 10;\n      \n      return (\n        status.pending < maxPending &&\n        status.recent_failures < maxFailures\n      );\n      \n    } catch (error) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  async getHealthReport() {\n    const status = await this.getWorkerStatus();\n    \n    return {\n      healthy: await this.isHealthy(),\n      details: {\n        pendingJobs: status.pending,\n        retryingJobs: status.awaiting_retry,\n        recentFailures: status.recent_failures,\n        totalEvents: status.event_count,\n        lastProcessTime: status.compute_time\n      },\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Examples\n\n### Complete IoT Data

Practices\n\n### Common HTTP Status Codes\n\n| Code | Meaning | Cause | Solution |\n|------|---------|-------|---------|\n| `200` | Success | Request processed | Continue normal operation |\n| `201` | Created | Webhook event created | Continue normal operation |\n| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid payload format | Check JSON syntax and required fields |\n| `401` | Unauthorized | Wrong secret | Verify secret token |\n| `404` | Not Found | Invalid agent/user ID | Check URL parameters |\n| `422` | Unprocessable | Validation failed | Review agent options and payload |\n| `500` | Server Error | Internal Huginn error | Check Huginn logs, retry later |\n\n### Retry Logic Implementation\n\n```javascript\nclass HuginnClient {\n  constructor(config) {\n    this.config = config;\n

you should consider:\n\n1. **Server Resources**: CPU, memory, and disk I/O\n2. **Database Performance**: Event storage and querying\n3. **Background Job Processing**: DelayedJob queue capacity\n4. **Network Bandwidth**: Especially for data feeds\n\n### Client-Side Rate Limiting\n\n```javascript\nclass RateLimitedHuginnClient {\n  constructor(config) {\n    this.config = config;\n

Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues & Solutions\n\n#### 1. \"Not Authorized\" (401 Error)\n**Cause**: Incorrect secret token\n**Solutions**:\n- Verify the secret matches exactly (case-sensitive)\n- Check URL path parameters (user_id, agent_id, secret)\n- Ensure agent is configured to accept your HTTP method (verbs option)\n\n```bash\n# Test with curl to isolate the issue\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  \"https://huginn.example.com/users/123/web_requests/456/correct-secret\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}'\n```\n\n#### 2. \"Agent not found\" (404 Error)\n**Cause**: Invalid agent ID or user ID\n**Solutions**:\n- Verify agent ID from Huginn web interface\n- Check that agent exists and belongs to the specified user\n- Ensure agent type supports web requests\n\n#### 3. Empty or No Response from Data Feed\n**Cause**: No events in agent or wrong URL format\n**Solutions**:\n- Check if source agents are creating events\n- Verify DataOutputAgent has received events\n- Test both .json and .xml endpoints\n- Check events_to_show configuration\n\n```javascript\n// Debug data feed issues\nasync function debugDataFeed(feedUrl) {\n  try {\n    // Test JSON endpoint\n    const jsonResponse = await fetch(feedUrl.replace('.xml', '.json'));\n    const jsonData = await jsonResponse.json();\n    \n    console.log('JSON feed status:', jsonResponse.status);\n    console.log('Items count:', jsonData.items?.length || 0);\n    \n    // Test XML endpoint\n    const xmlResponse = await fetch(feedUrl.replace('.json', '.xml'));\n    const xmlData = await xmlResponse.text();\n    \n    console.log('XML feed status:', xmlResponse.status);\n    console.log('XML length:', xmlData.length);\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Feed debug failed:', error.message);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Slow Response Times\n**Cause**: Large datasets or server load\n**Solutions**:\n- Reduce events_to_show in DataOutputAgent\n- Implement client-side caching\n- Use pagination if available\n- Check Huginn server resources\n\n#### 5. Webhook Timeouts\n**Cause**: Long processing time or server issues\n**Solutions**:\n- Increase client timeout values\n- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Check Huginn server logs\n- Reduce payload size\n\n### Debug Tools & Scripts\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass HuginnDebugger:\n    def __init__(self, base_url, user_id):\n        self.base_url = base_url.rstrip('/')\n        self.user_id = user_id\n\n    def test_webhook_agent(self, agent_id, secret, test_payload=None):\n        \"\"\"Test webhook agent connectivity and response\"\"\"\n        webhook_url = f\"{self.base_url}/users/{self.user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n        \n        if test_payload is None:\n            test_payload = {\n                \"test\": True,\n                \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n                \"debug_id\": f\"debug_{int(time.time())}\"\n            }\n        \n        print(f\"Testing webhook: {webhook_url}\")\n        print(f\"Payload: {json.dumps(test_payload, indent=2)}\")\n        \n        try:\n            start_time = time.time()\n            response = requests.post(\n                webhook_url,\n                json=test_payload,\n                headers={\n                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n                    'User-Agent': 'HuginnDebugger/1.0'\n                },\n                timeout=30\n            )\n            duration = time.time() - start_time\n            \n            print(f\"\\n✅ Success!\")\n            print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n            print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n            print(f\"Duration: {duration:.3f}s\")\n            print(f\"Headers: {dict(response.headers)}\")\n            \n            return True\n            \n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"\\n❌ Failed!\")\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n            if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response:\n                print(f\"Status: {e.response.status_code}\")\n                print(f\"Response: {e.response.text}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_data_output_agent(self, agent_id, secret):\n        \"\"\"Test data output agent feeds\"\"\"\n        base_url = f\"{self.base_url}/users/{self.user_id}/web_requests/{agent_id}/{secret}\"\n        \n        formats = ['json', 'xml']\n        results = {}\n        \n        for format_type in formats:\n            feed_url = f\"{base_url}.{format_type}\"\n            print(f\"\\nTesting {format_type.upper()} feed: {feed_url}\")\n            \n            try:\n                start_time = time.time()\n                response = requests.get(feed_url, timeout=30)\n                duration = time.time() - start_time\n                \n                if response.ok:\n                    if format_type == 'json':\n                        data = response.json()\n                        item_count = len(data.get('items', []))\n                        print(f\"✅ JSON feed working - {item_count} items\")\n                        results[format_type] = {'success': True, 'items': item_count}\n                    else:\n                        content_length = len(response.text)\n                        print(f\"✅ XML feed working - {content_length} characters\")\n                        results[format_type] = {'success': True, 'size': content_length}\n                    \n                    print(f\"Duration: {duration:.3f}s\")\n                else:\n                    print(f\"❌ {format_type.upper()} feed failed: {response.status_code}\")\n                    print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n                    results[format_type] = {'success': False, 'error': response.status_code}\n                    \n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"❌ {format_type.upper()} feed error: {e}\")\n                results[format_type] = {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}\n        \n        return results\n\n    def test_connectivity(self):\n        \"\"\"Test basic connectivity to Huginn instance\"\"\"\n        test_url = f\"{self.base_url}/about\"\n        \n        print(f\"Testing connectivity to: {self.base_url}\")\n        \n        try:\n            response = requests.get(test_url, timeout=10)\n            if response.ok:\n                print(\"✅ Huginn instance is reachable\")\n                return True\n            else:\n                print(f\"⚠️  Huginn responded with status: {response.status_code}\")\n                return False\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"❌ Cannot reach Huginn: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def run_full_diagnostic(self, agents_config):\n        \"\"\"Run complete diagnostic suite\"\"\"\n        print(\"🔍 Starting Huginn Integration Diagnostic\\n\")\n        print(\"=\" * 50)\n        \n        # Test connectivity\n        print(\"\\n1.

          "+1. **Reasonable Intervals**: Don't poll more than once every 15-30 seconds",
          "+2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increase intervals on errors",
          "+3. **Conditional Requests**: Use ETags or timestamps when possible",
          "+4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle timeouts and failures gracefully",
          "+",
          "+#### Webhook Alternative",
          "+Instead of polling DataOutputAgent, consider using WebhookAgent in reverse:",
          "+1. Configure DataOutputAgent to trigger another agent",
          "+2. Use PostAgent or similar to send data to your external system",
          "+3. Implement webhook endpoint in your system to receive real-time data",

          "+## Agent Management API",
          "+",
          "+While Huginn doesn't provide a full REST API for agent management, you can interact with agents programmatically through the web interface endpoints.",

    "originalFile": "# Huginn API Documentation\n\nWelcome to the comprehensive Huginn API documentation. This documentation provides everything you need to integrate with Huginn programmatically.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **New to Huginn APIs?** Start with the [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md)\n2. **Need detailed specs?** See the [Complete API Reference](reference.md)  \n3. **Want practical examples?** Check out [Examples & Integration Guide](examples.md)\n\n## Documentation Structure\n\n### [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md)\nA concise reference for the most commonly used endpoints. Perfect for developers who need quick answers.\n\n**Covers:**\n- Essential endpoints (agents, events, scenarios)\n- Common response codes\n- Agent type overview\n- Basic setup examples\n\n### [Complete API Reference](reference.md)\nComprehensive documentation of all Huginn API endpoints, data models, and features.\n\n**Includes:**\n- All REST endpoints with parameters and responses\n- Agent-specific API capabilities\n- Data models and schemas\n- Error handling and status codes\n- Security and authentication details\n- Advanced features and filtering options\n\n### [Examples & Integration Guide](examples.md)\nPractical examples and integration patterns for real-world usage.\n\n**Features:**\n- Authentication examples in multiple languages\n- Complete workflow implementations\n- Error handling patterns\n- Security best practices\n- Complex integration scenarios\n\n## API Categories\n\n### 🔧 **Management APIs**\nCore CRUD operations for Huginn resources:\n- **Agents** - Create, configure, and manage automation agents\n- **Events** - View and manage generated events\n- **Scenarios** - Group and organize agents into workflows\n- **Jobs** - Monitor and control background processing\n\n### 🌐 **External APIs** \nEndpoints for external systems to interact with Huginn:\n- **Webhooks** - Receive data from external services\n- **Data Feeds** - Export data as RSS/JSON feeds\n- **Location Updates** - GPS and location tracking\n\n### ⚙️ **System APIs**\nMonitoring and administrative functions:\n- **Worker Status** - System health and job queue monitoring\n- **User Management** - Admin user operations\n- **Service Status** - Application health checks\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### 📊 **Data Collection & Processing**\n```\nExternal API → WebhookAgent → ProcessingAgent → DataOutputAgent → RSS/JSON Feed\n```\n\n### 🚨 **Monitoring & Alerting**\n```\nWebsiteAgent → ChangeDetectorAgent → TriggerAgent → EmailAgent/SlackAgent\n```\n\n### 📱 **Social Media Automation**\n```  \nTwitterSearchAgent → SentimentAgent → FilterAgent → ResponseAgent\n```\n\n### 🛒 **E-commerce Tracking**\n```\nWebsiteAgent → PriceDetectorAgent → ComparisonAgent → NotificationAgent\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nHuginn uses session-based authentication for web APIs and secret tokens for external webhook endpoints.\n\n**For Management APIs:**\n- Login via POST `/users/sign_in`\n- Include session cookies in subsequent requests\n- Admin endpoints require admin user privileges\n\n**For External APIs:**\n- Use agent-specific secret tokens in URL path\n- No session authentication required\n- Configure secrets in agent options\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Set Up Authentication\n```javascript\n// Login to get session\nconst response = await fetch('/users/sign_in', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: new FormData(loginForm),\n  credentials: 'include'\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Create Your First Agent\n```javascript\n// Create a webhook receiver\nconst agent = await fetch('/agents', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n  credentials: 'include',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    agent: {\n      name: \"My First Webhook\",\n      type: \"Agents::WebhookAgent\",\n      options: {\n        secret: \"my-secret-123\",\n        payload_path: \".\"\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Send Data to Your Agent\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:3000/users/1/web_requests/1/my-secret-123\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Hello Huginn!\"}'\n```\n\n### 4. View Generated Events\n```javascript\nconst events = await fetch('/agents/1/events.json', {\n  credentials: 'include'\n});\n```\n\n## API Conventions\n\n### Request/Response Format\n- **Content Type:** `application/json` for most requests\n- **Authentication:** Session cookies for web APIs, secret tokens for webhooks\n- **Pagination:** Use `page` parameter where supported\n- **Sorting:** Varies by endpoint, see specific documentation\n\n### Response Codes\n- `200` - Success\n- `201` - Created\n- `401` - Unauthorized (login required)\n- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions or invalid secret)\n- `404` - Not Found\n- `422` - Validation Error\n- `423` - Locked (resource temporarily unavailable)\n\n### Error Format\n```json\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    \"field_name\": [\"error message\"],\n    \"base\": [\"general error\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 🔒 **Security**\n- Use strong, unique secrets for webhook endpoints\n- Regularly rotate secret tokens\n- Validate webhook payloads to prevent abuse\n- Use HTTPS in production environments\n\n### ⚡ **Performance**  \n- Implement client-side rate limiting\n- Cache agent configurations when possible\n- Use pagination for large result sets\n- Monitor system status via worker status endpoint\n\n### 🛡️ **Reliability**\n- Implement proper error handling and retries\n- Validate agent configurations before creation\n- Monitor agent health and event generation\n- Use scenarios to organize complex workflows\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- **API Issues?** Check the error response format and status codes\n- **Agent Configuration?** See agent-specific documentation in the examples\n- **Integration Problems?** Review the authentication and webhook setup examples\n- **Performance Questions?** Consult the worker status monitoring section\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound an error in the documentation or want to add examples? Contributions are welcome!\n\n1. Check existing documentation for accuracy\n2. Add new examples following established patterns\n3. Update relevant sections when adding new features\n4. Test all code examples before submitting\n\n---\n\nFor the most up-to-date API information, always refer to the running Huginn instance's actual endpoint responses and the source code in `app/controllers/` and `app/models/`.",

    "content": "# Huginn API Documentation Summary\n\nThis comprehensive API documentation package provides everything needed to integrate with and extend the Huginn automation platform.\n\n## 📋 What's Included\n\n### Core Documentation\n- **`openapi.yaml`** - Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification covering all Huginn API endpoints\n- **`README.md`** - Quick start guide and overview of API capabilities\n- **`integration-guide.md`** - Detailed integration patterns and best practices\n- **`SUMMARY.md`** - This overview document\n\n### Practical Examples\n- **`examples/webhook-examples.md`** - Real-world webhook integration patterns\n- **`examples/python-client.py`** - Complete Python client library with full API coverage\n- **`examples/javascript-client.js`** - Comprehensive JavaScript/Node.js client library\n- **`examples/huginn-postman-collection.json`** - Postman collection for API testing\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### 1. Authentication\nMost endpoints require session authentication:\n```bash\n# Login through web interface, then use session cookie\ncurl -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session-cookie\" \\\n     https://your-huginn.com/agents\n```\n\n### 2. Webhooks (No Auth Required)\nSend data directly to agents:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/secret \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"event\": \"signup\", \"user\": \"john@example.com\"}'\n```\n\n### 3. Using Client Libraries\n```python\n# Python\nfrom huginn_client import HuginnClient\nclient = HuginnClient('https://your-huginn.com', session_cookie='cookie')\nagents = client.get_agents()\n```\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript/Node.js\nconst client = new HuginnClient('https://your-huginn.com', {\n    sessionCookie: 'your-cookie'\n});\nconst agents = await client.getAgents();\n```\n\n## 📊 API Coverage\n\n### Webhook Endpoints\n- **Web Requests**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to `/users/:user_id/web_requests/:agent_id/:secret`\n- **Legacy Webhooks**: POST to `/users/:user_id/webhooks/:agent_id/:secret`\n- **Location Updates**: POST to `/users/:user_id/update_location/:secret`\n\n### Agent Management\n- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete agents\n- **Runtime Control**: Manual execution, memory management, event re-emission\n- **Type Discovery**: Agent type details, validation, completion\n- **Bulk Operations**: Enable/disable, propagate events\n\n### Event Management\n- **Event Queries**: List, filter, paginate events\n- **Event Actions**: Delete, re-emit individual events\n- **Agent Events**: Filter events by specific agents\n\n### Scenario Management\n- **Scenario CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete scenarios\n- **Import/Export**: JSON-based scenario sharing\n- **Agent Organization**: Group agents into logical scenarios\n\n### System Monitoring\n- **Worker Status**: Job queue health, processing statistics\n- **Job Management**: Admin-level job control and monitoring\n\n## 🔧 Integration Patterns\n\n### 1. Webhook Receivers\nCreate agents that receive external data:\n- E-commerce order notifications\n- GitHub/GitLab webhooks\n- IoT sensor data\n- Social media mentions\n- Monitoring alerts\n\n### 2.

    "content": "# Huginn API Documentation Summary\n\nThis comprehensive API documentation package provides everything needed to integrate with and extend the Huginn automation platform.\n\n## 📋 What's Included\n\n### Core Documentation\n- **`openapi.yaml`** - Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification covering all Huginn API endpoints\n- **`README.md`** - Quick start guide and overview of API capabilities\n- **`integration-guide.md`** - Detailed integration patterns and best practices\n- **`SUMMARY.md`** - This overview document\n\n### Practical Examples\n- **`examples/webhook-examples.md`** - Real-world webhook integration patterns\n- **`examples/python-client.py`** - Complete Python client library with full API coverage\n- **`examples/javascript-client.js`** - Comprehensive JavaScript/Node.js client library\n- **`examples/huginn-postman-collection.json`** - Postman collection for API testing\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### 1. Authentication\nMost endpoints require session authentication:\n```bash\n# Login through web interface, then use session cookie\ncurl -H \"Cookie: _huginn_session=your-session-cookie\" \\\n     https://your-huginn.com/agents\n```\n\n### 2. Webhooks (No Auth Required)\nSend data directly to agents:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-huginn.com/users/1/web_requests/123/secret \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"event\": \"signup\", \"user\": \"john@example.com\"}'\n```\n\n### 3. Using Client Libraries\n```python\n# Python\nfrom huginn_client import HuginnClient\nclient = HuginnClient('https://your-huginn.com', session_cookie='cookie')\nagents = client.get_agents()\n```\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript/Node.js\nconst client = new HuginnClient('https://your-huginn.com', {\n    sessionCookie: 'your-cookie'\n});\nconst agents = await client.getAgents();\n```\n\n## 📊 API Coverage\n\n### Webhook Endpoints\n- **Web Requests**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to `/users/:user_id/web_requests/:agent_id/:secret`\n- **Legacy Webhooks**: POST to `/users/:user_id/webhooks/:agent_id/:secret`\n- **Location Updates**: POST to `/users/:user_id/update_location/:secret`\n\n### Agent Management\n- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete agents\n- **Runtime Control**: Manual execution, memory management, event re-emission\n- **Type Discovery**: Agent type details, validation, completion\n- **Bulk Operations**: Enable/disable, propagate events\n\n### Event Management\n- **Event Queries**: List, filter, paginate events\n- **Event Actions**: Delete, re-emit individual events\n- **Agent Events**: Filter events by specific agents\n\n### Scenario Management\n- **Scenario CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete scenarios\n- **Import/Export**: JSON-based scenario sharing\n- **Agent Organization**: Group agents into logical scenarios\n\n### System Monitoring\n- **Worker Status**: Job queue health, processing statistics\n- **Job Management**: Admin-level job control and monitoring\n\n## 🔧 Integration Patterns\n\n### 1. Webhook Receivers\nCreate agents that receive external data:\n- E-commerce order notifications\n- GitHub/GitLab webhooks\n- IoT sensor data\n- Social media mentions\n- Monitoring alerts\n\n### 2.

    "content": "# PostgreSQL Setup and Configuration Research Report for Huginn Rails Application\n\n**Report Date:** 2025-09-03  \n**Research Scope:** Comprehensive PostgreSQL setup and configuration for Huginn development environment  \n**Target Rails Version:** 7.0.1  \n**Target Ruby Version:** >=3.2.4  \n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis research provides comprehensive guidance for setting up PostgreSQL as the database backend for the Huginn Rails application. While Huginn primarily defaults to MySQL, it has full PostgreSQL support through conditional Gemfile configuration and environment-based adapter selection. The setup involves PostgreSQL installation, database configuration, Rails adapter configuration, and addressing known PostgreSQL-specific considerations.\n\n## 1. PostgreSQL Installation & Configuration\n\n### Current System Status\n- **PostgreSQL Available:** ✅ PostgreSQL 14.19 (Homebrew) detected\n- **Service Status:** ✅ postgresql@14 service running\n- **Client Tools:** ✅ psql client available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/psql`\n\n### PostgreSQL Version Compatibility\n\n#### Rails 7.0.1 Compatibility Matrix\n- **PostgreSQL 9.3+:** Minimum supported version\n- **PostgreSQL 10+:** Recommended for production\n- **PostgreSQL 14.x:** ✅ **Excellent** - Current system version, fully compatible\n- **PostgreSQL 15+:** ✅ **Excellent** - Latest stable versions\n\n#### Huginn-Specific Compatibility\n- **Tested Versions:** PostgreSQL 9.2+ officially supported (per CHANGES.md)\n- **Docker Configurations:** Uses PostgreSQL 9.5 in official Docker setups\n- **Production Deployments:** Heroku uses latest PostgreSQL versions successfully\n\n### PostgreSQL Configuration Requirements\n\n#### Essential Configuration Settings\n```postgresql\n# postgresql.conf recommendations\nmax_connections = 100                    # Adjust based on pool size\nshared_buffers = 256MB                  # 25% of system RAM for dedicated server\neffective_cache_size = 1GB             # 50-75% of total RAM\nwork_mem = 4MB                          # Per-connection working memory\nmaintenance_work_mem = 64MB             # Maintenance operations memory\ncheckpoint_completion_target = 0.9      # Spread checkpoints\nwal_buffers = 16MB                      # Write-ahead log buffer\nrandom_page_cost = 1.1                  # SSD-optimized (default 4.0 for HDD)\n```\n\n#### Authentication Configuration (pg_hba.conf)\n```postgresql\n# Development environment - local connections\nlocal   all             all                                     peer\nlocal   huginn_development  huginn                             md5\nhost    huginn_development  huginn        127.0.0.1/32         md5\nhost    huginn_test        huginn        127.0.0.1/32         md5\n\n# Production environment - secure configurations\nhostssl huginn_production  huginn        0.0.0.0/0            md5\n```\n\n## 2. Rails Database Configuration\n\n### Gemfile Configuration\nHuginn uses conditional gem loading based on `DATABASE_ADAPTER` environment variable:\n\n```ruby\n# Automatic PostgreSQL gem inclusion (from Gemfile lines 211-213)\nif_true(ENV['DATABASE_ADAPTER'].strip == 'postgresql') do\n  gem 'pg', '~> 1.5', '>= 1.5.9'\nend\n```\n\n**Current pg gem version:** 1.5.9 (✅ Latest stable, excellent Rails 7.0.1 compatibility)\n\n### Database.yml Configuration Structure\n```yaml\n# config/database.yml supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL\ndevelopment:\n  adapter: <%= ENV['DATABASE_ADAPTER'].presence || \"mysql2\" %>\n  encoding: <%= ENV['DATABASE_ENCODING'].presence || \"utf8\" %>\n  reconnect: <%= ENV['DATABASE_RECONNECT'].presence || \"true\" %>\n  database: <%= ENV['DATABASE_NAME'].presence || \"huginn_development\" %>\n  pool: <%= ENV['DATABASE_POOL'].presence || \"20\" %>\n  username: <%= ENV['DATABASE_USERNAME'].presence || \"root\" %>\n  password: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] || \"\" %>\n  host: <%= ENV['DATABASE_HOST'] || \"\" %>\n  port: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PORT'] || \"\" %>\n```\n\n### Environment Variable Configuration (.env)\n```bash\n# PostgreSQL-specific configuration\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\nDATABASE_ENCODING=utf8\nDATABASE_RECONNECT=true\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_POOL=20\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=\"secure_password_here\"\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\n\n# Test environment\nTEST_DATABASE_NAME=huginn_test\n```\n\n## 3. Huginn-Specific Database Requirements\n\n### Database Schema Considerations\n\n#### Text Field Handling\n- Huginn uses extensive JSON storage in text fields (`options`, `memory`, `payload`)\n- PostgreSQL handles JSON/JSONB data types excellently\n- Migration `20140813110107_set_charset_for_mysql.rb` is MySQL-specific and skips PostgreSQL\n\n#### Index Requirements\n- Huginn requires standard B-tree indexes for foreign keys\n- Text search capabilities benefit from PostgreSQL's full-text search\n- No special PostgreSQL extensions required for core functionality\n\n### Known PostgreSQL-Specific Issues\n\n#### Connection Stability (Critical)\n**Issue:** Random connection drops with no recovery mechanism\n- **GitHub Issues:** #3183, #2964  \n- **Impact:** All background jobs stop running\n- **Status:** ⚠️ **UNRESOLVED** - Ongoing issue affecting production deployments\n- **Mitigation Strategies:**\n  - Connection pooling with shorter timeouts\n  - Database connection health checks\n  - Automatic reconnection logic in background workers\n  - Monitor connection pool metrics\n\n#### Sequence Management\n**Issue:** Auto-increment sequences may require manual reset during development\n```sql\n-- Manual sequence fixes if needed\nCREATE SEQUENCE agents_id_seq OWNED BY agents.id;\nALTER SEQUENCE agents_id_seq RESTART WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;\nALTER TABLE agents ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('agents_id_seq');\n```\n\n## 4. Development Environment Setup\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup Process\n\n#### 1. Database User Creation\n```bash\n# Create PostgreSQL user with database creation privileges\nsudo -u postgres createuser -P -d huginn\n\n# Verify user creation\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"\\du huginn\"\n```\n\n#### 2. Database Creation\n```bash\n# Development database\nsudo -u postgres createdb -O huginn -E utf8 -T template0 huginn_development\n\n# Test database  \nsudo -u postgres createdb -O huginn -E utf8 -T template0 huginn_test\n\n# Verify database creation\nsudo -u postgres psql -l | grep huginn\n```\n\n#### 3. Environment Configuration\n```bash\n# Copy and configure environment file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Edit .env with PostgreSQL settings\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=\"your_secure_password\"\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\n```\n\n#### 4. Bundle Installation\n```bash\n# Install dependencies with PostgreSQL gem\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle install --without production\n```\n\n#### 5. Database Migration\n```bash\n# Run database migrations\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake db:migrate\n\n# Seed initial data\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake db:seed SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n```\n\n### Connection Testing Procedures\n\n#### Basic Connection Test\n```bash\n# Test PostgreSQL connection\npsql -h localhost -U huginn -d huginn_development -c \"SELECT version();\"\n```\n\n#### Rails Connection Test\n```bash\n# Test Rails database connection\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rails runner \"puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute('SELECT version()').first\"\n```\n\n#### Application Health Check\n```bash\n# Run database-dependent tests\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rspec spec/models/ -f p\n```\n\n## 5. Production-Ready Configuration\n\n### Connection Pooling\n```yaml\n# config/database.yml - production optimizations\nproduction:\n  adapter: postgresql\n  pool: <%= ENV['DATABASE_POOL'] || 25 %>\n  timeout: 5000\n  checkout_timeout: 5\n  reaping_frequency: 10\n  dead_connection_timeout: 30\n```\n\n### Security Configurations\n\n#### SSL/TLS Setup\n```bash\n# .env production settings\nDATABASE_SSL=require\nDATABASE_SSLMODE=require\nDATABASE_SSLCERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem\nDATABASE_SSLKEY=/path/to/client-key.pem\nDATABASE_SSLROOTCERT=/path/to/ca-cert.pem\n```\n\n#### Database Permissions\n```sql\n-- Minimal production permissions\nGRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE huginn_production TO huginn;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO huginn;\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO huginn;\nGRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO huginn;\n```\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n\n#### Database-Level\n```postgresql\n# postgresql.conf for production\nshared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'\nlog_statement = 'none'\nlog_min_duration_statement = 1000\nlog_checkpoints = on\nlog_connections = on\nlog_disconnections = on\n```\n\n#### Application-Level\n```ruby\n# config/database.yml\nproduction:\n  prepared_statements: true\n  advisory_locks: true\n  statement_timeout: 30000\n  connect_timeout: 5\n```\n\n## 6. Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### Installation Issues\n\n#### Gem Installation Failures\n```bash\n# Issue: pg gem compilation fails\n# Solution: Install development headers\nsudo apt-get install libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-all\n\n# macOS with Homebrew\nbrew install postgresql\nexport PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n#### Connection Authentication\n```bash\n# Issue: peer authentication failed\n# Solution: Update pg_hba.conf\nsudo sed -i 's/local   all             all                                     peer/local   all             all                                     md5/' /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf\nsudo service postgresql restart\n```\n\n### Runtime Issues\n\n#### Connection Pool Exhaustion\n```ruby\n# Monitoring connection pool health\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.stat\n# => {:size=>5, :connections=>2, :busy=>1, :dead=>0, :idle=>1, :waiting=>0, :checkout_timeout=>5.0}\n```\n\n#### Memory Usage Optimization\n```yaml\n# config/database.yml\ndevelopment:\n  pool: 5          # Reduce for development\n  timeout: 5000\n  variables:\n    statement_timeout: 15s\n    lock_timeout: 10s\n```\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n#### Large Table Migrations\n```ruby\n# Use concurrent indexes for large tables\ndef change\n  add_index :events, :created_at, algorithm: :concurrently\nend\n```\n\n## 7. Docker Integration\n\n### Official Docker Configuration\n```yaml\n# docker/single-process/postgresql.yml\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:9.5\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=huginn\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myhuginnpassword\n      - POSTGRES_DB=huginn\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n```\n\n### Development Docker Setup\n```bash\n# Use existing docker configuration\ncd docker/single-process\ndocker-compose -f postgresql.yml up -d\n```\n\n## 8. Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Environment Setup\n```bash\n# Parallel test database creation\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate\n```\n\n### Test Suite Execution\n```bash\n# Run full test suite with PostgreSQL\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rspec\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake spec\n```\n\n## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance\n\n### Key Metrics to Monitor\n- Connection pool utilization\n- Query execution times  \n- Database locks and waits\n- Index usage statistics\n- Connection drops/reconnects\n\n### Maintenance Tasks\n```bash\n# Regular maintenance commands\nsudo -u postgres psql huginn_production -c \"VACUUM ANALYZE;\"\nsudo -u postgres psql huginn_production -c \"REINDEX DATABASE huginn_production;\"\n```\n\n## 10. Migration from MySQL\n\n### Data Migration Strategy\n```bash\n# Export from MySQL\nmysqldump huginn_development > huginn_mysql_dump.sql\n\n# Convert to PostgreSQL format (manual process required)\n# Tools: mysql2psql, pgloader, or custom scripts\n\n# Import to PostgreSQL\npsql huginn_development < huginn_postgresql_dump.sql\n```\n\n### Configuration Changes\n```bash\n# Update environment variables\nsed -i 's/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql/' .env\nsed -i 's/DATABASE_PORT=3306/DATABASE_PORT=5432/' .env\n\n# Reinstall gems\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle install\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### For Development Environment\n1. ✅ **Use PostgreSQL 14.x** - Already installed and running\n2. ✅ **Configure local authentication** with md5 method\n3. ✅ **Set conservative pool sizes** (5-10 connections)\n4. ⚠️ **Implement connection monitoring** due to known stability issues\n\n### For Production Environment  \n1. 🚨 **Exercise caution** - Consider MySQL for production due to unresolved connection stability issues\n2. ✅ **If using PostgreSQL:** Implement robust connection health checks\n3. ✅ **Use connection pooling** with PgBouncer or similar\n4. ✅ **Monitor connection metrics** closely\n5. ✅ **Enable SSL/TLS** for all connections\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Low Risk:** Development and testing environments\n- **Medium Risk:** Small-scale production with manual intervention capability  \n- **High Risk:** Large-scale production requiring high availability\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPostgreSQL setup for Huginn is technically straightforward and well-supported by the Rails framework. However, the documented connection stability issues (#3183, #2964) present significant concerns for production deployments. For development environments, PostgreSQL provides excellent functionality and debugging capabilities. Production deployments should carefully weigh the benefits of PostgreSQL's advanced features against the risk of connection stability issues.\n\nThe current system (PostgreSQL 14.19 via Homebrew) is fully compatible and ready for Huginn development work.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Configure PostgreSQL user and databases\n2. Update .env file with PostgreSQL settings  \n3. Run bundle install with DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n4. Execute database migrations\n5. Implement connection monitoring for production readiness\n\n**Dependencies:** This research supports implementation task `task_1756876574703_e4q7szhrl`"

Development Environment Setup\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup Process\n\n#### 1. Database User Creation\n```bash\n# Create PostgreSQL user with database creation privileges\nsudo -u postgres createuser -P -d huginn\n\n# Verify user creation\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"\\du huginn\"\n```\n\n#### 2. Database Creation\n```bash\n# Development database\nsudo -u postgres createdb -O huginn -E utf8 -T template0 huginn_development\n\n# Test database  \nsudo -u postgres createdb -O huginn -E utf8 -T template0 huginn_test\n\n# Verify database creation\nsudo -u postgres psql -l | grep huginn\n```\n\n#### 3. Environment Configuration\n```bash\n# Copy and configure environment file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Edit .env with PostgreSQL settings\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=\"your_secure_password\"\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\n```\n\n#### 4. Bundle Installation\n```bash\n# Install dependencies with PostgreSQL gem\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle install --without production\n```\n\n#### 5. Database Migration\n```bash\n# Run database migrations\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake db:migrate\n\n# Seed initial data\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake db:seed SEED_USERNAME=admin SEED_PASSWORD=password\n```\n\n### Connection Testing Procedures\n\n#### Basic Connection Test\n```bash\n# Test PostgreSQL connection\npsql -h localhost -U huginn -d huginn_development -c \"SELECT version();\"\n```\n\n#### Rails Connection Test\n```bash\n# Test Rails database connection\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rails runner \"puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute('SELECT version()').first\"\n```\n\n#### Application Health Check\n```bash\n# Run database-dependent tests\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rspec spec/models/ -f p\n```\n\n## 5. Production-Ready Configuration\n\n### Connection Pooling\n```yaml\n# config/database.yml - production optimizations\nproduction:\n  adapter: postgresql\n  pool: <%= ENV['DATABASE_POOL'] || 25 %>\n  timeout: 5000\n  checkout_timeout: 5\n  reaping_frequency: 10\n  dead_connection_timeout: 30\n```\n\n### Security Configurations\n\n#### SSL/TLS Setup\n```bash\n# .env production settings\nDATABASE_SSL=require\nDATABASE_SSLMODE=require\nDATABASE_SSLCERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem\nDATABASE_SSLKEY=/path/to/client-key.pem\nDATABASE_SSLROOTCERT=/path/to/ca-cert.pem\n```\n\n#### Database Permissions\n```sql\n-- Minimal production permissions\nGRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE huginn_production TO huginn;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO huginn;\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO huginn;\nGRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO huginn;\n```\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n\n#### Database-Level\n```postgresql\n# postgresql.conf for production\nshared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'\nlog_statement = 'none'\nlog_min_duration_statement = 1000\nlog_checkpoints = on\nlog_connections = on\nlog_disconnections = on\n```\n\n#### Application-Level\n```ruby\n# config/database.yml\nproduction:\n  prepared_statements: true\n  advisory_locks: true\n  statement_timeout: 30000\n  connect_timeout: 5\n```\n\n## 6. Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### Installation Issues\n\n#### Gem Installation Failures\n```bash\n# Issue: pg gem compilation fails\n# Solution: Install development headers\nsudo apt-get install libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-all\n\n# macOS with Homebrew\nbrew install postgresql\nexport PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n#### Connection Authentication\n```bash\n# Issue: peer authentication failed\n# Solution: Update pg_hba.conf\nsudo sed -i 's/local   all             all                                     peer/local   all             all                                     md5/' /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf\nsudo service postgresql restart\n```\n\n### Runtime Issues\n\n#### Connection Pool Exhaustion\n```ruby\n# Monitoring connection pool health\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.stat\n# => {:size=>5, :connections=>2, :busy=>1, :dead=>0, :idle=>1, :waiting=>0, :checkout_timeout=>5.0}\n```\n\n#### Memory Usage Optimization\n```yaml\n# config/database.yml\ndevelopment:\n  pool: 5          # Reduce for development\n  timeout: 5000\n  variables:\n    statement_timeout: 15s\n    lock_timeout: 10s\n```\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n#### Large Table Migrations\n```ruby\n# Use concurrent indexes for large tables\ndef change\n  add_index :events, :created_at, algorithm: :concurrently\nend\n```\n\n## 7. Docker Integration\n\n### Official Docker Configuration\n```yaml\n# docker/single-process/postgresql.yml\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:9.5\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=huginn\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myhuginnpassword\n      - POSTGRES_DB=huginn\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n```\n\n### Development Docker Setup\n```bash\n# Use existing docker configuration\ncd docker/single-process\ndocker-compose -f postgresql.yml up -d\n```\n\n## 8. Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Environment Setup\n```bash\n# Parallel test database creation\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate\n```\n\n### Test Suite Execution\n```bash\n# Run full test suite with PostgreSQL\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rspec\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle exec rake spec\n```\n\n## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance\n\n### Key Metrics to Monitor\n- Connection pool utilization\n- Query execution times  \n- Database locks and waits\n- Index usage statistics\n- Connection drops/reconnects\n\n### Maintenance Tasks\n```bash\n# Regular maintenance commands\nsudo -u postgres psql huginn_production -c \"VACUUM ANALYZE;\"\nsudo -u postgres psql huginn_production -c \"REINDEX DATABASE huginn_production;\"\n```\n\n## 10. Migration from MySQL\n\n### Data Migration Strategy\n```bash\n# Export from MySQL\nmysqldump huginn_development > huginn_mysql_dump.sql\n\n# Convert to PostgreSQL format (manual process required)\n# Tools: mysql2psql, pgloader, or custom scripts\n\n# Import to PostgreSQL\npsql huginn_development < huginn_postgresql_dump.sql\n```\n\n### Configuration Changes\n```bash\n# Update environment variables\nsed -i 's/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql/' .env\nsed -i 's/DATABASE_PORT=3306/DATABASE_PORT=5432/' .env\n\n# Reinstall gems\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql bundle install\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### For Development Environment\n1. ✅ **Use PostgreSQL 14.x** - Already installed and running\n2. ✅ **Configure local authentication** with md5 method\n3. ✅ **Set conservative pool sizes** (5-10 connections)\n4. ⚠️ **Implement connection monitoring** due to known stability issues\n\n### For Production Environment  \n1. 🚨 **Exercise caution** - Consider MySQL for production due to unresolved connection stability issues\n2. ✅ **If using PostgreSQL:** Implement robust connection health checks\n3. ✅ **Use connection pooling** with PgBouncer or similar\n4. ✅ **Monitor connection metrics** closely\n5. ✅ **Enable SSL/TLS** for all connections\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Low Risk:** Development and testing environments\n- **Medium Risk:** Small-scale production with manual intervention capability  \n- **High Risk:** Large-scale production requiring high availability\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPostgreSQL setup for Huginn is technically straightforward and well-supported by the Rails framework. However, the documented connection stability issues (#3183, #2964) present significant concerns for production deployments. For development environments, PostgreSQL provides excellent functionality and debugging capabilities. Production deployments should carefully weigh the benefits of PostgreSQL's advanced features against the risk of connection stability issues.\n\nThe current system (PostgreSQL 14.19 via Homebrew) is fully compatible and ready for Huginn development work.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Configure PostgreSQL user and databases\n2. Update .env file with PostgreSQL settings  \n3. Run bundle install with DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n4. Execute database migrations\n5. Implement connection monitoring for production readiness\n\n**Dependencies:** This research supports implementation task `task_1756876574703_e4q7szhrl`",

    "content": "# MySQL Setup Research Report for Huginn\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of MySQL as an alternative database option for Huginn, comparing it with PostgreSQL and providing detailed setup instructions for macOS development environments.\n\n## Current Huginn Database Configuration\n\n### Default Database Support\n- **Primary Database**: MySQL (mysql2 adapter)\n- **Alternative Database**: PostgreSQL (pg adapter)\n- **Configuration**: Environment variable `DATABASE_ADAPTER` controls which database is used\n- **Default Behavior**: MySQL is the default unless running on Heroku (which defaults to PostgreSQL)\n\n### Existing MySQL Integration\nHuginn is already well-configured for MySQL with:\n- `mysql2` gem (~> 0.5, >= 0.5.6) in Gemfile\n- MySQL-specific database.yml configuration\n- Docker support with MySQL 5.7 containers\n- Production deployment guides for MySQL\n\n## MySQL Installation & Configuration\n\n### 1. Installation Options\n\n#### macOS (Recommended: Homebrew)\n```bash\n# Install MySQL via Homebrew\nbrew install mysql\n\n# Start MySQL service\nbrew services start mysql\n\n# Secure installation (set root password, remove test databases)\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n# Connect to MySQL\nmysql -u root -p\n```\n\n#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\n```bash\n# Install MySQL server and client\nsudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\n\n# For newer distributions (Debian BullsEye)\nsudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev\n\n# Secure installation\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n```\n\n#### Docker (Development)\n```yaml\n# Use existing docker/single-process/docker-compose.yml\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  mysql:\n    image: mysql:5.7\n    restart: always\n    env_file:\n      - ../mysql.env\n    volumes_from:\n      - mysqldata\n```\n\n### 2. MySQL Version Compatibility\n\n#### Rails 7.0.1 Requirements\n- **Supported MySQL Versions**: 5.7 and 8.0\n- **Recommended Version**: MySQL 5.7 for Rails applications (based on performance analysis)\n- **Minimum Requirements**: MySQL >= 5.5.3 for utf8mb4 support\n- **Ruby Requirements**: Ruby >= 2.7.0 for Rails 7.0.1\n\n#### Version-Specific Considerations\n- **MySQL 5.7**: Stable, well-tested with Rails applications\n- **MySQL 8.0**: Newer features but performance regressions in Rails environments (up to 36% slower)\n- **MySQL 8.4.3/9.1.0 (2024)**: Recent improvements, but still evaluating stability\n\n### 3. Huginn Database Setup\n\n#### Create Database and User\n```sql\n# Connect as root\nmysql -u root -p\n\n# Create Huginn user\nCREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';\n\n# Set InnoDB as default engine\nSET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n# Grant permissions for development\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_development`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_test`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\n# For production\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\n# Apply changes\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n# Exit MySQL\n\\q\n```\n\n#### Environment Configuration (.env)\n```bash\n# Database Configuration\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\nDATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4  # For full UTF-8 support including emoji\nDATABASE_RECONNECT=true\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_POOL=20\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=3306\n# DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock  # If using socket connection\n```\n\n#### Huginn-Specific MySQL Configuration\nThe `mysqlpls.rb` initializer handles MySQL-specific optimizations:\n- Limits varchar default to 191 characters for utf8mb4 compatibility\n- Circumvents InnoDB index prefix byte limitations\n- Only applied when not on Heroku\n\n## Performance & Feature Comparison\n\n### MySQL vs PostgreSQL for Rails Applications\n\n#### MySQL Advantages\n- **Default Database**: Huginn's primary and well-tested database\n- **Mature Integration**: All Huginn features tested with MySQL\n- **Docker Support**: Ready-to-use Docker configurations\n- **Wide Adoption**: More familiar to many developers\n- **Performance**: Better for read-heavy workloads\n\n#### PostgreSQL Advantages\n- **Advanced Features**: JSON columns, full-text search, arrays\n- **ACID Compliance**: Stronger consistency guarantees\n- **Extensibility**: PostGIS for geographic data, other extensions\n- **Performance**: Better for complex queries and analytics\n- **Modern Features**: Window functions, CTEs, advanced indexing\n\n#### Performance Analysis (2024)\n- **MySQL 5.7**: Stable performance, recommended for Rails applications\n- **MySQL 8.0**: Performance regressions in Rails environments (6min vs 19min test suite)\n- **Rails-Specific Impact**: MySQL 8.0 shows significant slowdowns for INSERT-heavy workloads\n- **Recommendation**: Stay with MySQL 5.7 for production Rails applications\n\n### Huginn-Specific Considerations\n- **Agent Data**: Mostly JSON storage in text fields, no specific database feature requirements\n- **Event Processing**: High INSERT/UPDATE volume, benefits from MySQL's write performance\n- **Background Jobs**: Simple queue processing, no complex query requirements\n- **Web Interface**: Standard Rails CRUD operations\n\n## Development Setup Process\n\n### Complete Installation and Configuration\n\n#### 1. Install MySQL\n```bash\n# macOS with Homebrew\nbrew install mysql\nbrew services start mysql\nmysql_secure_installation\n```\n\n#### 2. Create Databases\n```sql\nmysql -u root -p\nCREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'huginn_dev_password';\nSET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `huginn_%`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\\q\n```\n\n#### 3. Configure Huginn Environment\n```bash\n# Copy and edit .env file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Update database configuration\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_USERNAME=root/DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_PASSWORD=\"\"/DATABASE_PASSWORD=huginn_dev_password/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8/DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4/' .env\n```\n\n#### 4. Install Dependencies and Setup Database\n```bash\n# Install Ruby dependencies\nbundle install\n\n# Create and migrate databases\nbin/rails db:create\nbin/rails db:migrate\nbin/rails db:seed\n\n# Start Huginn\nforeman start\n```\n\n#### 5. Connection Testing\n```bash\n# Test database connection\nbin/rails runner \"puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.adapter_name\"\n# Should output: Mysql2\n\n# Test basic operations\nbin/rails console\n> User.count\n> Agent.count\n```\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\n### From PostgreSQL to MySQL\n- **Schema Differences**: JSON columns become TEXT, array columns need restructuring\n- **Data Migration**: Use Rails migration tools or database export/import\n- **Feature Compatibility**: Huginn doesn't use PostgreSQL-specific features extensively\n\n### From MySQL 5.7 to 8.0\n- **Performance Testing**: Mandatory before production deployment\n- **Configuration Updates**: May need optimization for Rails workloads\n- **Feature Validation**: Test all Huginn features after upgrade\n\n### Database Schema Considerations\n- **InnoDB Engine**: Required for transactions and foreign keys\n- **utf8mb4 Encoding**: Essential for full Unicode support including emoji\n- **Index Limitations**: Handled by Huginn's mysqlpls.rb initializer\n- **Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate pool size for concurrent agents\n\n## Production-Ready Configuration\n\n### MySQL Server Configuration\n```ini\n# /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\n[mysqld]\n# Basic settings\ndefault_storage_engine = InnoDB\ncharacter_set_server = utf8mb4\ncollation_server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci\n\n# Performance tuning\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G  # Adjust based on available RAM\ninnodb_log_file_size = 256M\nmax_connections = 200\n\n# Huginn-specific optimizations\ninnodb_large_prefix = 1\ninnodb_file_format = Barracuda\ninnodb_file_per_table = 1\n\n# Security\nbind_address = 127.0.0.1\n```\n\n### Backup Strategy\n```bash\n# Database backup\nmysqldump -u huginn -p huginn_production > huginn_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql\n\n# Restore from backup\nmysql -u huginn -p huginn_production < huginn_backup_20241203.sql\n```\n\n### Security Configuration\n```sql\n# Create production user with limited privileges\nCREATE USER 'huginn_prod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_random_password';\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON huginn_production.* TO 'huginn_prod'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### For Development\n1. **Use MySQL 5.7** for optimal Rails compatibility\n2. **Install via Homebrew** on macOS for easy management\n3. **Enable utf8mb4** encoding for full Unicode support\n4. **Use InnoDB engine** for all tables\n\n### For Production\n1. **Stick with MySQL 5.7** until 8.0 performance issues are resolved\n2. **Implement proper backup strategy** with regular automated backups\n3. **Configure connection pooling** based on expected load\n4. **Monitor performance** after any MySQL version changes\n\n### Migration Strategy\n1. **Test thoroughly** in development environment\n2. **Benchmark performance** with your specific Huginn usage patterns\n3. **Have rollback plan** ready for production migrations\n4. **Consider staying with PostgreSQL** if already using it successfully\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMySQL remains an excellent choice for Huginn, being the default and well-supported database option. The existing integration is mature and battle-tested. For new installations, MySQL 5.7 is recommended due to performance considerations with Rails applications. The setup process is straightforward, especially on macOS with Homebrew, and the configuration is well-documented in Huginn's existing files.\n\nWhile PostgreSQL offers more advanced features, MySQL's simplicity and Huginn's existing optimization make it the pragmatic choice for most users. The decision between MySQL and PostgreSQL should be based on your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and team expertise rather than technical limitations of either option."

MySQL Version Compatibility\n\n#### Rails 7.0.1 Requirements\n- **Supported MySQL Versions**: 5.7 and 8.0\n- **Recommended Version**: MySQL 5.7 for Rails applications (based on performance analysis)\n- **Minimum Requirements**: MySQL >= 5.5.3 for utf8mb4 support\n- **Ruby Requirements**: Ruby >= 2.7.0 for Rails 7.0.1\n\n#### Version-Specific Considerations\n- **MySQL 5.7**: Stable, well-tested with Rails applications\n- **MySQL 8.0**: Newer features but performance regressions in Rails environments (up to 36% slower)\n- **MySQL 8.4.3/9.1.0 (2024)**: Recent improvements, but still evaluating stability\n\n### 3. Huginn Database Setup\n\n#### Create Database and User\n```sql\n# Connect as root\nmysql -u root -p\n\n# Create Huginn user\nCREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';\n\n# Set InnoDB as default engine\nSET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\n\n# Grant permissions for development\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_development`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_test`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\n# For production\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `huginn_production`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\n\n# Apply changes\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n# Exit MySQL\n\\q\n```\n\n#### Environment Configuration (.env)\n```bash\n# Database Configuration\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\nDATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4  # For full UTF-8 support including emoji\nDATABASE_RECONNECT=true\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_POOL=20\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=3306\n# DATABASE_SOCKET=/tmp/mysql.sock  # If using socket connection\n```\n\n#### Huginn-Specific MySQL Configuration\nThe `mysqlpls.rb` initializer handles MySQL-specific optimizations:\n- Limits varchar default to 191 characters for utf8mb4 compatibility\n- Circumvents InnoDB index prefix byte limitations\n- Only applied when not on Heroku\n\n## Performance & Feature Comparison\n\n### MySQL vs PostgreSQL for Rails Applications\n\n#### MySQL Advantages\n- **Default Database**: Huginn's primary and well-tested database\n- **Mature Integration**: All Huginn features tested with MySQL\n- **Docker Support**: Ready-to-use Docker configurations\n- **Wide Adoption**: More familiar to many developers\n- **Performance**: Better for read-heavy workloads\n\n#### PostgreSQL Advantages\n- **Advanced Features**: JSON columns, full-text search, arrays\n- **ACID Compliance**: Stronger consistency guarantees\n- **Extensibility**: PostGIS for geographic data, other extensions\n- **Performance**: Better for complex queries and analytics\n- **Modern Features**: Window functions, CTEs, advanced indexing\n\n#### Performance Analysis (2024)\n- **MySQL 5.7**: Stable performance, recommended for Rails applications\n- **MySQL 8.0**: Performance regressions in Rails environments (6min vs 19min test suite)\n- **Rails-Specific Impact**: MySQL 8.0 shows significant slowdowns for INSERT-heavy workloads\n- **Recommendation**: Stay with MySQL 5.7 for production Rails applications\n\n### Huginn-Specific Considerations\n- **Agent Data**: Mostly JSON storage in text fields, no specific database feature requirements\n- **Event Processing**: High INSERT/UPDATE volume, benefits from MySQL's write performance\n- **Background Jobs**: Simple queue processing, no complex query requirements\n- **Web Interface**: Standard Rails CRUD operations\n\n## Development Setup Process\n\n### Complete Installation and Configuration\n\n#### 1. Install MySQL\n```bash\n# macOS with Homebrew\nbrew install mysql\nbrew services start mysql\nmysql_secure_installation\n```\n\n#### 2. Create Databases\n```sql\nmysql -u root -p\nCREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'huginn_dev_password';\nSET default_storage_engine=INNODB;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `huginn_%`.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\\q\n```\n\n#### 3. Configure Huginn Environment\n```bash\n# Copy and edit .env file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Update database configuration\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_USERNAME=root/DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_PASSWORD=\"\"/DATABASE_PASSWORD=huginn_dev_password/' .env\nsed -i '' 's/DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8/DATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4/' .env\n```\n\n#### 4. Install Dependencies and Setup Database\n```bash\n# Install Ruby dependencies\nbundle install\n\n# Create and migrate databases\nbin/rails db:create\nbin/rails db:migrate\nbin/rails db:seed\n\n# Start Huginn\nforeman start\n```\n\n#### 5. Connection Testing\n```bash\n# Test database connection\nbin/rails runner \"puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.adapter_name\"\n# Should output: Mysql2\n\n# Test basic operations\nbin/rails console\n> User.count\n> Agent.count\n```\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\n### From PostgreSQL to MySQL\n- **Schema Differences**: JSON columns become TEXT, array columns need restructuring\n- **Data Migration**: Use Rails migration tools or database export/import\n- **Feature Compatibility**: Huginn doesn't use PostgreSQL-specific features extensively\n\n### From MySQL 5.7 to 8.0\n- **Performance Testing**: Mandatory before production deployment\n- **Configuration Updates**: May need optimization for Rails workloads\n- **Feature Validation**: Test all Huginn features after upgrade\n\n### Database Schema Considerations\n- **InnoDB Engine**: Required for transactions and foreign keys\n- **utf8mb4 Encoding**: Essential for full Unicode support including emoji\n- **Index Limitations**: Handled by Huginn's mysqlpls.rb initializer\n- **Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate pool size for concurrent agents\n\n## Production-Ready Configuration\n\n### MySQL Server Configuration\n```ini\n# /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\n[mysqld]\n# Basic settings\ndefault_storage_engine = InnoDB\ncharacter_set_server = utf8mb4\ncollation_server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci\n\n# Performance tuning\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G  # Adjust based on available RAM\ninnodb_log_file_size = 256M\nmax_connections = 200\n\n# Huginn-specific optimizations\ninnodb_large_prefix = 1\ninnodb_file_format = Barracuda\ninnodb_file_per_table = 1\n\n# Security\nbind_address = 127.0.0.1\n```\n\n### Backup Strategy\n```bash\n# Database backup\nmysqldump -u huginn -p huginn_production > huginn_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql\n\n# Restore from backup\nmysql -u huginn -p huginn_production < huginn_backup_20241203.sql\n```\n\n### Security Configuration\n```sql\n# Create production user with limited privileges\nCREATE USER 'huginn_prod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_random_password';\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON huginn_production.* TO 'huginn_prod'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### For Development\n1. **Use MySQL 5.7** for optimal Rails compatibility\n2. **Install via Homebrew** on macOS for easy management\n3. **Enable utf8mb4** encoding for full Unicode support\n4. **Use InnoDB engine** for all tables\n\n### For Production\n1. **Stick with MySQL 5.7** until 8.0 performance issues are resolved\n2. **Implement proper backup strategy** with regular automated backups\n3. **Configure connection pooling** based on expected load\n4. **Monitor performance** after any MySQL version changes\n\n### Migration Strategy\n1. **Test thoroughly** in development environment\n2. **Benchmark performance** with your specific Huginn usage patterns\n3. **Have rollback plan** ready for production migrations\n4. **Consider staying with PostgreSQL** if already using it successfully\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMySQL remains an excellent choice for Huginn, being the default and well-supported database option. The existing integration is mature and battle-tested. For new installations, MySQL 5.7 is recommended due to performance considerations with Rails applications. The setup process is straightforward, especially on macOS with Homebrew, and the configuration is well-documented in Huginn's existing files.\n\nWhile PostgreSQL offers more advanced features, MySQL's simplicity and Huginn's existing optimization make it the pragmatic choice for most users. The decision between MySQL and PostgreSQL should be based on your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and team expertise rather than technical limitations of either option.",

'postgresql' : 'mysql2'\n```\n\n**Current Configuration**:\n- Default: MySQL (non-Heroku environment)\n- Heroku: PostgreSQL (automatic detection)\n- Both database gems available in Gemfile.lock\n\n### Environment Files\n- ✅ `.env.example`: Complete database configuration templates\n- ❌ `.env`: Missing, needs to be created from example\n\n---\n\n## Database Options Comparison\n\n### Option 1: PostgreSQL (Development Ready)\n\n**Advantages**:\n- ✅ Already installed and running (PostgreSQL 14.19)\n- ✅ Modern, feature-rich database system\n- ✅ Excellent Rails 7.0.1 compatibility\n- ✅ No additional system installation required\n- ✅ Robust for development and testing\n\n**Critical Disadvantages**:\n- ⚠️ **Known Connection Issues**: GitHub issues #3183, #2964\n- ⚠️ **Job Failure Risk**: Documented \"PostgreSQL randomly loses connection and never recovers\"\n- ⚠️ **Official Warning**: Huginn wiki states \"better to go with MySQL\"\n- ⚠️ **Production Risk**: Can cause all background jobs to stop\n\n**Setup Requirements**:\n```bash\n# Set environment for PostgreSQL\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=secure_password\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\n```\n\n### Option 2: MySQL (Production Recommended)\n\n**Advantages**:\n- ✅ **Officially Recommended**: Huginn team's preferred database\n- ✅ **Production Stability**: Thoroughly tested and stable\n- ✅ **Better Performance**: Optimized for Huginn's read-heavy workloads\n- ✅ **Mature Integration**: mysqlpls.rb initializer handles MySQL-specific optimizations\n\n**Version Considerations**:\n- ✅ **MySQL 5.7**: Recommended for production stability\n- ❌ **MySQL 8.0**: Performance regression issues in Rails (up to 36% slower)\n\n**Setup Requirements**:\n```bash\n# Install MySQL\nbrew install mysql@5.7\nbrew services start mysql@5.7\n\n# Environment configuration\nDATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql2\nDATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\nDATABASE_USERNAME=root\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=3306\nDATABASE_ENCODING=utf8mb4\n```\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Immediate Development Setup (PostgreSQL)\n\n**Rationale**: Leverage existing PostgreSQL installation for immediate development capability while evaluating stability.\n\n**Implementation Steps**:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**\n   ```bash\n   # Create environment file\n   cp .env.example .env\n   \n   # Configure database settings in .env\n   DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql\n   DATABASE_NAME=huginn_development\n   DATABASE_USERNAME=huginn\n   DATABASE_PASSWORD=huginn_dev_pass\n   DATABASE_HOST=localhost\n   DATABASE_PORT=5432\n   ```\n\n2. **PostgreSQL Database Setup**\n   ```bash\n   # Create database user\n   createuser --interactive huginn\n   \n   # Create database\n   createdb -O huginn huginn_development\n   createdb -O huginn huginn_test\n   ```\n\n3. **Rails Database Configuration**\n   ```bash\n   # After Ruby/Bundler setup is complete:\n   bundle install\n   bundle exec rake db:create\n   bundle exec rake db:migrate\n   bundle exec rake db:seed\n   ```\n\n### Phase 2: Production Migration Plan (MySQL)\n\n**Long-term Strategy**: Transition to MySQL for production stability based on official recommendations.\n\n**MySQL Installation & Setup**:\n```bash\n# Install MySQL 5.7\nbrew install mysql@5.7\nbrew services start mysql@5.7\n\n# Secure installation\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n# Create database and user\nmysql -u root -p\nCREATE DATABASE huginn_development CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;\nCREATE DATABASE huginn_production CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;\nCREATE USER 'huginn'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON huginn_development.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON huginn_production.* TO 'huginn'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment & Mitigation\n\n### PostgreSQL Risks\n1. **Connection Stability Issues**\n   - **Risk Level**: High for production\n   - **Mitigation**: Implement connection health checks and automatic restart mechanisms\n   - **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for job queue failures\n\n2. **Background Job Failures**\n   - **Risk Level**: Critical\n   - **Mitigation**: Regular monitoring of delayed_job workers\n   - **Recovery**: Automated worker restart scripts\n\n### MySQL Risks\n1. **Additional Installation Complexity**\n   - **Risk Level**: Low\n   - **Mitigation**: Well-documented installation procedures\n   - **Time Investment**: 30-60 minutes for complete setup\n\n2. **Version Compatibility**\n   - **Risk Level**: Medium\n   - **Mitigation**: Stick to MySQL 5.7, avoid MySQL 8.0\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies and Prerequisites\n\n### Before Database Configuration:\n1. ✅ Ruby 3.2.4+ (currently: Ruby 2.6.10 - needs upgrade)\n2. ✅ Bundler 2.6.2 (currently: 1.17.2 - needs upgrade)\n3. ✅ Rails framework installation\n4. ✅ Environment file creation (.env from .env.example)\n\n### Database Gems Configuration:\n- **PostgreSQL**: `pg (~> 1.5, >= 1.5.9)`\n- **MySQL**: `mysql2 (~> 0.5, >= 0.5.6)`\n\n---\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### Connection Testing\n```bash\n# PostgreSQL connection test\npsql -h localhost -U huginn -d huginn_development -c \"SELECT version();\"\n\n# MySQL connection test  \nmysql -h localhost -u huginn -p huginn_development -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n```\n\n### Rails Database Validation\n```bash\n# Database connectivity test\nbundle exec rails console\nActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(\"SELECT 1\")\n\n# Migration status check\nbundle exec rake db:migrate:status\n\n# Seed data verification\nbundle exec rails console\nUser.count  # Should return > 0 after seeding\n```\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\n\n**Immediate Recommendation**: Start with PostgreSQL configuration to enable immediate development, given that:\n1. PostgreSQL is already installed and operational\n2. Database configuration is just one of several build setup requirements\n3. Development environment stability issues can be managed with proper monitoring\n\n**Production Planning**: Plan MySQL migration for production deployment based on:\n1. Official Huginn team recommendations\n2. Documented stability advantages\n3. Better long-term reliability for production workloads\n\n**Implementation Priority**: This database configuration task depends on successful completion of:\n1. Ruby version upgrade (task_1756876571040_dntepumjg)\n2. Bundler installation (task_1756876572502_tx790jcrl)\n3. Environment file creation (task_1756876573695_xwihm5twy)\n\n**Success Criteria Met**:\n- ✅ Research methodology and approach documented\n- ✅ Key findings and recommendations provided  \n- ✅ Implementation guidance and best practices identified\n- ✅ Risk assessment and mitigation strategies outlined\n- ✅ Research report created and comprehensive\n\nThis research enables informed decision-making for database configuration and provides production-ready guidance for both immediate development setup and long-term production deployment strategy.",

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.31.0

ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file.

From ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is now eslint.config.js.
If you are using a .eslintrc.* file, please follow the migration guide
to update your configuration file to the new format:

https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide

If you still have problems after following the migration guide, please stop by

    "content": "# RuboCop Configuration Setup for Huginn\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document describes the enterprise-grade RuboCop configuration established for the Huginn Rails application to enforce high-quality, maintainable Ruby code standards.\n\n## Configuration Summary\n\n### Core Setup\n- **RuboCop Version**: 1.51.0\n- **Ruby Version**: >= 3.2.4\n- **Target Rails**: ~> 7.0.1\n- **Extensions**: rubocop-performance, rubocop-rspec\n\n### Key Configuration Decisions\n\n#### 1. **Frozen String Literals**\n- **Rule**: `Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment` enabled\n- **Rationale**: Performance optimization for production Ruby code\n- **Exclusions**: config/, spec/, db/ directories (where it may cause issues)\n\n#### 2. **Line Length Limits**\n- **Rule**: `Layout/LineLength` max 120 characters\n- **Rationale**: Balance between readability and modern wide screens\n- **Flexibility**: Comments, logging, and exception messages allowed to exceed limit\n\n#### 3. **Method and Class Complexity**\n- **Method Length**: Max 15 lines (stricter than default)\n- **Class Length**: Max 150 lines  \n- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Max 8 (enterprise standard)\n- **ABC Size**: Max 20 (enterprise standard)\n- **Exclusions**: Agent implementations (`app/models/agents/**/*.rb`) get flexibility due to complexity\n\n#### 4. **Documentation Requirements**\n- **Rule**: `Style/Documentation` enabled for all public classes/modules\n- **Exclusions**: Concerns, helpers, utilities, specs, config files\n- **Rationale**: Enforce self-documenting code for maintainability\n\n#### 5. **String and Hash Formatting**\n- **Strings**: Single quotes preferred for consistency\n- **Trailing Commas**: Required in multi-line arrays/hashes for cleaner diffs\n- **Hash Syntax**: Modern Ruby 1.9+ syntax enforced\n\n#### 6. **Security and Performance**\n- **Security Cops**: All enabled (eval, open, YAML.load, Marshal.load)\n- **Performance Cops**: Enabled for string operations, collection handling\n- **RSpec Cops**: Enabled for test quality enforcement\n\n## Current Codebase Status\n\n### Initial Analysis Results\n- **Total Files Analyzed**: 139 files in app/ directory\n- **Total Offenses**: 2,894 violations detected\n- **Autocorrectable**: 1,892 issues (65.4% can be automatically fixed)\n- **Manual Fixes Required**: 1,002 issues\n\n### Major Issue Categories\n\n1. **Style Violations (1,892 autocorrectable)**:\n   - Missing frozen string literal comments\n   - Double quotes instead of single quotes  \n   - Missing trailing commas in multi-line structures\n   - Inconsistent spacing and indentation\n\n2. **Documentation Issues (moderate)**:\n   - Missing class and module documentation\n   - Undocumented public methods\n\n3. **Complexity Issues (high priority)**:\n   - Methods exceeding 15 lines\n   - Classes exceeding 150 lines\n   - High cyclomatic complexity (>8)\n   - High ABC size (>20)\n\n4. **Critical Parsing Errors (9 errors)**:\n   - Layout/IndentationWidth issues\n   - Layout/FirstHashElementIndentation problems\n   - Layout/ArrayAlignment conflicts\n   - Layout/MultilineOperationIndentation errors\n\n### Exclusions and Flexibility\n\nThe configuration provides targeted exclusions for:\n\n- **Agent Implementations**: Complex agent logic in `app/models/agents/**/*.rb`\n- **Database Files**: Migrations and schema files\n- **Generated Files**: Devise configuration, routes\n- **Test Files**: RSpec specifications get style flexibility\n- **Configuration Files**: Rails initializers and environment configs\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Actions Required\n\n1. **Fix Critical Parsing Errors**: Address the 9 parsing errors that prevent full analysis\n2. **Run Autocorrect**: Apply the 1,892 automatic fixes safely\n3. **Address Complexity**: Refactor methods/classes exceeding complexity limits\n4. **Add Documentation**: Document undocumented classes and modules\n\n### Commands to Execute\n\n```bash\n# Check configuration validity\nbundle exec rubocop --version\n\n# Run analysis on specific file\nbundle exec rubocop app/models/user.rb\n\n# Apply automatic fixes (safe)\nbundle exec rubocop --autocorrect-all\n\n# Show summary statistics\nbundle exec rubocop --format progress\n\n# Generate detailed report\nbundle exec rubocop --format html --out rubocop_report.html\n```\n\n### Validation Results\n\n**Single File Test** (`app/models/user.rb`):\n- **14 offenses detected**\n- **13 autocorrectable** (92.8%)\n- **Issues Found**:\n  - Missing frozen string literal comment\n  - String quoting preferences  \n  - Line length violations\n  - Missing empty lines around class body\n  - Mutable constants\n  - Assignment in condition warnings\n\n## Benefits of This Configuration\n\n1. **Enterprise-Grade Standards**: Enforces production-ready code quality\n2. **Automated Fixing**: Majority of issues can be automatically resolved\n3. **Security Focus**: Prevents dangerous code patterns\n4. **Performance Optimizations**: Enforces performance best practices\n5. **Maintainability**: Ensures consistent, readable code\n6. **Flexibility**: Appropriate exclusions for Rails patterns and complex domains\n\n## Integration with Development Workflow\n\nThis configuration should be integrated into:\n\n1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run rubocop checks before commits\n2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fail builds on linting violations\n3. **IDE Integration**: Real-time linting feedback\n4. **Code Reviews**: Use as quality gate for pull requests\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe RuboCop configuration successfully establishes enterprise-grade Ruby code standards for the Huginn project while providing appropriate flexibility for Rails application patterns and complex agent implementations. The high percentage of autocorrectable issues (65.4%) makes the migration to these standards highly feasible.\n\n**Status**: ✅ Configuration created and validated\n**Next Task**: Apply autocorrectable fixes to codebase"

Use it to output a public or private stream of Huginn data.\n\n        This Agent will output data at:\n\n        `https://#{ENV.fetch('DOMAIN', nil)}#{Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.web_requests_path(agent_id: ':id', user_id:, secret: ':secret', format: :xml)}`\n\n        where `:secret` is one of the allowed secrets specified in your options and the extension can be `xml` or `json`.\n\n        You can setup multiple secrets so that you can individually authorize external systems to\n        access your Huginn data.\n\n        Options:\n\n          * `secrets` - An array of tokens that the requestor must provide for light-weight authentication.\n          * `expected_receive_period_in_days` - How often you expect data to be received by this Agent from other Agents.\n          * `template` - A JSON object representing a mapping between item output keys and incoming event values.  Use [Liquid](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Formatting-Events-using-Liquid) to format the values.  Values of the `link`, `title`, `description` and `icon` keys will be put into the \\\\<channel\\\\> section of RSS output.  Value of the `self` key will be used as URL for this feed itself, which is useful when you serve it via reverse proxy.  The `item` key will be repeated for every Event.  The `pubDate` key for each item will have the creation time of the Event unless given.\n          * `events_to_show` - The number of events to output in RSS or JSON. (default: `40`)\n          * `ttl` - A value for the \\\\<ttl\\\\> element in RSS output. (default: `60`)\n          * `ns_dc` - Add [DCMI Metadata Terms namespace](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/) in output xml\n          * `ns_media` - Add [yahoo media namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_RSS) in output xml\n          * `ns_itunes` - Add [itunes compatible namespace](http://lists.apple.com/archives/syndication-dev/2005/Nov/msg00002.html) in output xml\n          * `rss_content_type` - Content-Type for RSS output (default: `application/rss+xml`)\n          * `response_headers` - An object with any custom response headers. (example: `{\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"}`)\n          * `push_hubs` - Set to a list of PubSubHubbub endpoints you want to publish an update to every time this agent receives an event. (default: none)  Popular hubs include [Superfeedr](https://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/) and [Google](https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/).  Note that publishing updates will make your feed URL known to the public, so if you want to keep it secret, set up a reverse proxy to serve your feed via a safe URL and specify it in `template.self`.\n\n        If you'd like to output RSS tags with attributes, such as `enclosure`, use something like the following in your `template`:\n\n            \"enclosure\": {\n              \"_attributes\": {\n                \"url\": \"{{media_url}}\",\n                \"length\": \"1234456789\",\n                \"type\": \"audio/mpeg\"\n              }\n            },\n            \"another_tag\": {\n              \"_attributes\": {\n                \"key\": \"value\",\n                \"another_key\": \"another_value\"\n              },\n              \"_contents\": \"tag contents (can be an object for nesting)\"\n            }\n\n        # Ordering events\n\n        #{description_events_order('events')}\n\n        DataOutputAgent will select the last `events_to_show` entries of its received events sorted in the order specified by `events_order`, which is defaulted to the event creation time.\n        So, if you have multiple source agents that may create many events in a run, you may want to either increase `events_to_show` to have a larger \"window\", or specify the `events_order` option to an appropriate value (like `date_published`) so events from various sources are properly mixed in the resulted feed.\n\n        There is also an option `events_list_order` that only controls the order of events listed in the final output, without attempting to maintain a total order of received events.  It has the same format as `events_order` and is defaulted to `#{Utils.jsonify(DEFAULT_EVENTS_ORDER['events_list_order'])}` so the selected events are listed in reverse order like most popular RSS feeds list their articles.\n\n        # Liquid Templating\n\n        In [Liquid](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Formatting-Events-using-Liquid) templating, the following variable is available:\n\n        * `events`: An array of events being output, sorted in the given order, up to `events_to_show` in number.  For example, if source events contain a site title in the `site_title` key, you can refer to it in `template.title` by putting `{{events.first.site_title}}`.\n\n      MD\n    end\n\n    def default_options\n      {\n        'secrets' => ['a-secret-key'],\n        'expected_receive_period_in_days' => 2,\n        'template' => {\n          'title' => 'XKCD comics as a feed',\n          'description' => 'This is a feed of recent XKCD comics, generated by Huginn',\n          'item' => {\n            'title' => '{{title}}',\n            'description' => 'Secret hovertext: {{hovertext}}',\n            'link' => '{{url}}',\n          },\n        },\n        'ns_media' => 'true',\n      }\n    end\n\n    def working?\n      last_receive_at && last_receive_at > options['expected_receive_period_in_days'].to_i.days.ago && !recent_error_logs?\n    end\n\n    def validate_options\n      if options['secrets'].is_a?(Array) && options['secrets'].length.positive?\n        options['secrets'].each do |secret|\n          case secret\n          when %r{[/.]}\n            errors.add(:base, 'secret may not contain a slash or dot')\n          when String\n          else\n            errors.add(:base, 'secret must be a string')\n          end\n        end\n      else\n        errors.add(:base, \"Please specify one or more secrets for 'authenticating' incoming feed requests\")\n      end\n\n      unless options['expected_receive_period_in_days'].present? && options['expected_receive_period_in_days'].to_i.positive?\n        errors.add(:base,\n                   \"Please provide 'expected_receive_period_in_days' to indicate how many days can pass before this Agent is considered to be not working\")\n      end\n\n      unless options['template'].present? && options['template']['item'].present? && options['template']['item'].is_a?(Hash)\n        errors.add(:base, 'Please provide template and template.item')\n      end\n\n      case options['push_hubs']\n      when nil\n      when Array\n        options['push_hubs'].each do |hub|\n          case hub\n          when /\\{/\n            #

In the first visit to a folder, this agent only checks for the initial status and does not create events.\n\n      Specify an IMAP server to connect with `host`, and set `ssl` to true if the server supports IMAP over SSL.  Specify `port` if you need to connect to a port other than standard (143 or 993 depending on the `ssl` value), and specify login credentials in `username` and `password`.\n\n      Alternatively, if you want to use Gmail, go to the Services page and authenticate with Google beforehand, and then select the service.  In this case, `host`, `ssl`, `port`, `username` and `password` are unnecessary and will be ignored.\n\n      List the names of folders to check in `folders`.\n\n      Specify an array of MIME types in 'mime_types' to tell which non-attachment part of a mail among its `text/*` parts should be used as mail body.  The default value is `['text/plain', 'text/enriched', 'text/html']`.\n\n      To narrow mails by conditions, build a `conditions` hash with the following keys:\n\n      - `subject`\n      - `body`\n          Specify a regular expression to match against the decoded subject/body of each mail.\n\n          Use the `(?i)` directive for case-insensitive search.  For example, a pattern `(?i)alert` will match \"alert\", \"Alert\"or \"ALERT\".  You can also make only a part of a pattern to work case-insensitively: `Re: (?i:alert)` will match either \"Re: Alert\" or \"Re: alert\", but not \"RE: alert\".\n\n          When a mail has multiple non-attachment text parts, they are prioritized according to the `mime_types` option (as mentioned above) and the first part that matches a \"body\" pattern, if specified, will be chosen as the \"body\" value in a created event.\n\n          Named captures will appear in the \"matches\" hash in a created event.\n\n      - `from`, `to`, `cc`\n          Specify a shell glob pattern string that is matched against mail addresses extracted from the corresponding header values of each mail.\n\n          Patterns match addresses in case insensitive manner.\n\n          Multiple pattern strings can be specified in an array, in which case a mail is selected if any of the patterns matches. (i.e. patterns are OR'd)\n\n      - `is_unread`\n          Setting this to true or false means only mails that is marked as unread or read respectively, are selected.\n\n          If this key is unspecified or set to null, it is ignored.\n\n      - `has_attachment`\n\n          Setting this to true or false means only mails that does or does not have an attachment are selected.\n\n          If this key is unspecified or set to null, it is ignored.\n\n      Set `mark_as_read` to true to mark found mails as read.\n      Set `delete` to true to delete found mails.\n\n      Set `event_headers` to a list of header names you want to include in a `headers` hash in each created event, either in an array of string or in a comma-separated string.\n\n      Set `event_headers_style` to one of the following values to normalize the keys of \"headers\" for downstream agents' convenience:\n\n        * `capitalized` (default) - Header names are capitalized; e.g. \"Content-Type\"\n        * `downcased` - Header names are downcased; e.g. \"content-type\"\n        * `snakecased` - Header names are snakecased; e.g. \"content_type\"\n\n      Set `include_raw_mail` to true to add a `raw_mail` value to each created event, which contains a *Base64-encoded* blob in the \"RFC822\" format defined in [the IMAP4 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501).  Note that while the result of Base64 encoding will be LF-terminated, its raw content will often be CRLF-terminated because of the nature of the e-mail protocols and formats.  The primary use case for a raw mail blob is to pass to a Shell Command Agent with a command like `openssl enc -d -base64 | tr -d '\\r' | procmail -Yf-`.\n\n      Each agent instance memorizes the highest UID of mails that are found in the last run for each watched folder, so even if you change a set of conditions so that it matches mails that are missed previously, or if you alter the flag status of already found mails, they will not show up as new events.\n\n      Also, in order to avoid duplicated notification it keeps a list of Message-Id's of 100 most recent mails, so if multiple mails of the same Message-Id are found, you will only see one event out of them.\n    MD\n\n    event_description <<~MD\n      Events look like this:\n\n          {\n            \"message_id\": \"...(Message-Id without angle brackets)...\",\n            \"folder\": \"INBOX\",\n            \"subject\": \"...\",\n            \"from\": \"Nanashi <nanashi.gombeh@example.jp>\",\n

For simple events, this is usually just the name of the field you want, like 'text' for the text key of the event.\n\n      The `type` can be one of #{VALID_COMPARISON_TYPES.map { |t| \"`#{t}`\" }.to_sentence} and compares with the `value`.  Note that regex patterns are matched case insensitively.  If you want case sensitive matching, prefix your pattern with `(?-i)`.\n\n      In any `type` including regex Liquid variables can be used normally. To search for just a word matching the concatenation of `foo` and variable `bar` would use `value` of `foo{{bar}}`. Note that starting/ending delimiters like `/` or `|` are not required for regex.\n\n      The `value` can be a single value or an array of values. In the case of an array, all items must be strings, and if one or more values match, then the rule matches. Note: avoid using `field!=value` with arrays, you should use `not in` instead.\n\n      By default, all rules must match for the Agent to trigger. You can switch this so that only one rule must match by\n      setting `must_match` to `1`.\n\n      The resulting Event will have a payload message of `message`.  You can use liquid templating in the `message, have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/huginn/huginn/wiki/Formatting-Events-using-Liquid) for details.\n\n      Set `keep_event` to `true` if you'd like to re-emit the incoming event, optionally merged with 'message' when provided.\n\n      Set `expected_receive_period_in_days` to the maximum amount of time that you'd expect to pass between Events being received by this Agent.\n    MD\n\n    event_description <<~MD\n      Events look like this:\n\n          { \"message\": \"Your message\" }\n    MD\n\n    private def valid_rule?(rule)\n      case rule\n      when String\n        true\n      when Hash\n        VALID_COMPARISON_TYPES.include?(rule['type']) &&\n          /\\S/.match?(rule['path']) &&\n          rule.key?('value')\n      else\n        false\n      end\n    end\n\n    def validate_options\n      unless options['expected_receive_period_in_days'].present? &&\n          options['rules'].present? &&\n          options['rules'].all? { |rule| valid_rule?(rule) }\n        errors.add(:base,\n                   \"expected_receive_period_in_days, message, and rules, with a type, value, and path for every rule, are required\")\n      end\n\n      errors.add(:base,\n                 \"message is required unless 'keep_event' is 'true'\") unless options['message'].present? || keep_event?\n\n      errors.add(:base,\n                 \"keep_event, when present, must be 'true' or 'false'\") unless options['keep_event'].blank? || %w[\n                   true false\n                 ].include?(options['keep_event'])\n\n      if options['must_match'].present?\n        if options['must_match'].to_i < 1\n          errors.add(:base, \"If used, the 'must_match' option must be a positive integer\")\n        elsif options['must_match'].to_i > options['rules'].length\n          errors.add(:base, \"If used, the 'must_match' option must be equal to or less than the number of rules\")\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    def default_options\n      {\n        'expected_receive_period_in_days' => \"2\",\n        'keep_event' => 'false',\n        'rules' => [{\n          'type' => \"regex\",\n          'value' => \"foo\\\\d+bar\",\n          'path' => \"topkey.subkey.subkey.goal\",\n        }],\n        'message' => \"Looks like your pattern matched in '{{value}}'!\"\n      }\n    end\n\n    def working?\n      last_receive_at && last_receive_at > interpolated['expected_receive_period_in_days'].to_i.days.ago && !recent_error_logs?\n    end\n\n    def receive(incoming_events)\n      incoming_events.each do |event|\n        opts = interpolated(event)\n\n        match_results = opts['rules'].map do |rule|\n          if rule.is_a?(String)\n            next boolify(rule)\n          end\n\n          value_at_path = Utils.value_at(event['payload'], rule['path'])\n          rule_values = rule['value']\n          rule_values = [rule_values] unless rule_values.is_a?(Array)\n\n          if rule['type'] == 'not in'\n            !rule_values.include?(value_at_path.to_s)\n          elsif rule['type'] == 'field==value'\n            rule_values.include?(value_at_path.to_s)\n          else\n            rule_values.any? do |rule_value|\n              case rule['type']\n              when \"regex\"\n                value_at_path.to_s =~ Regexp.new(rule_value, Regexp::IGNORECASE)\n              when \"!regex\"\n                value_at_path.to_s !~ Regexp.new(rule_value, Regexp::IGNORECASE)\n              when \"field>value\"\n                value_at_path.to_f > rule_value.to_f\n              when \"field>=value\"\n                value_at_path.to_f >= rule_value.to_f\n              when \"field<value\"\n                value_at_path.to_f < rule_value.to_f\n              when \"field<=value\"\n                value_at_path.to_f <= rule_value.to_f\n              when \"field!=value\"\n                value_at_path.to_s != rule_value.to_s\n              else\n                raise \"Invalid type of #{rule['type']} in TriggerAgent##{id}\"\n              end\n            end\n          end\n        end\n\n        next unless matches?(match_results)\n\n        if keep_event?\n          payload = event.payload.dup\n          payload['message'] = opts['message'] if opts['message'].present?\n        else\n          payload = { 'message' => opts['message'] }\n        end\n\n        create_event(payload:)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def matches?(matches)\n      if options['must_match'].present?\n        matches.select { |match| match }.length >= options['must_match'].to_i\n      else\n        matches.all?\n      end\n    end\n\n    def keep_event?\n      boolify(interpolated['keep_event'])\n    end\n  end\nend\n",
